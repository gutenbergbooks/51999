<div><h1><span class='gesp'>PREFACE</span>.</h1></div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Although</span> General Sherman’s military career
has only reached its most interesting and brilliant
period, grateful and admiring thousands will welcome
an authentic outline of his history to the present
time. The facts of his early life were obtained
from those who knew him best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Colonel Bowman, an appreciative friend of
General Sherman, whose sketches of him in the
<span class='it'>U. S. Service Magazine</span> were graphic and reliable,
to the <span class='it'>Army and Navy Journal</span> and able correspondents,
we are indebted for valuable material.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pen-portrait of the great commander, by Mr.
Alvord, which has never before been published, will
be read with special interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The volume is not offered to the public as a complete
biography, with all that might have been omitted
carefully sifted from the essential statements,
but the annals of a remarkable man, with incidents
connected with his movements; affording the youth
and all others, a general view of the nation’s hero,
from infancy to the unrivalled distinction he now
holds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May the unpretending volume stimulate the
youthful mind to virtuous and noble deeds, while
it contributes to the more complete and voluminous
memoirs which will be written in the peaceful future
before us, for whose blessings of a perpetuated Union
and civil liberty we shall owe a lasting debt of
gratitude to General Sherman.</p>

The Boyhood of Heroes—The ancestry of William Teeumseh Sherman—The
death of his Father—Why the name of the Indian Chief was given him—The
Birth-place of William Tecumseh.
</div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/m.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='M'/>Y youthful reader, you have heard the adage,
“the boy is father of the man;” which means
clearly, that the principles and habits of early
years form the character and destiny of after
life. And you will find in the history of nearly
all great and good men, in this country certainly, that
they began, in humble circumstances, their career. Not
that poverty is necessary to success, but the struggle to
carve one’s own way in the world, the almost unaided
effort to secure an education for a profession or business,
develops and strengthens character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another thing is true of deservedly eminent men;
they were obedient and dutiful while under the parental
roof. A selfish, rebellious boy, never made an honored
member of society and of the State. You will find illustrations
of these truths in the lives of Washington, Adams,
Lincoln, Grant, Mitchel, Sherman, and many others,
whose fame is lasting as our institutions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 1634 the Hon. Samuel Sherman, his
brother, Rev. John Sherman, and their cousin, Captain
John Sherman, who were residents of Dedham, England,
came to this country. This was only thirteen years after
the <span class='it'>May Flower</span>, with its pilgrim company, rocked in
Massachusetts Bay. There were no ocean steamers
then proudly ploughing the broad Atlantic. In a ship
like the plain bark which bore the first colony, whose
free principles, civil and religious, lie at the foundation
of this Republic, they embarked for the wilderness of the
New World.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You can see, in imagination, the white-winged vessel
glide from its haven into the “wide, wide sea,” and float
like a speck over the waste of waters. The winds blow,
the crested billows toss the <span class='it'>Shermans</span>, with the rest of
the ship’s company, about for weeks; they little dreaming
of quite a different storm, in which a descendant
would figure so conspicuously, just two hundred and
thirty years later. At length the ship reached Boston
harbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rev. John Sherman; a graduate of Immanuel
College, “and a Puritan,” went at once to his work. The
Sabbath dawned, and under an ancient tree in the present
town of Watertown, three miles from Boston, you might
have seen a quiet and attentive congregation listening to
his first sermon in America. Here he settled, after receiving
a call to Milford, Conn. Some of his descendants
were excellent and popular divines. The captain also
settled there; and from his branch of the family came
Roger Sherman, the signer of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hon. Samuel Sherman pushed on to Wethersfield,
Conn. Soon after he removed to Stamford, and finally
settled down in Stratford. The “coat of arms,” that is
to say, the family escutcheon or badge, bears a lion rampant,
and a sea lion on the crest. The motto is: “Conquer
death by virtue.” From him descended the “hero
of our story,” whose grandfather, Taylor Sherman, for
many years judge, died May 4th, 1815, in the ripeness
of his manhood, at the age of fifty-eight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The widow, like the families of Generals Grant and
Mitchel, and of our most worthy President, turned her
face toward the far West; for it was then a long and
weary way to the rich valleys of the Mississippi and its
tributaries. The beautiful State of Ohio—the empire
State of the western world—became her home. The
prospects, for her sons especially, on the cheap, rich soil,
and in the rising towns of that vast and new territory,
were much better than in New England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pleasant settlement of Lancaster was their first
residence. Subsequently she removed to Mansfield, in the
same State, where she died in 1848. Her children were
Charles Robert, who was born September 26th, 1788,
Daniel and Betsey. Charles married Mary Hoyt, May
8th, 1810, and settled in Lancaster. His profession was
law, in which he excelled particularly as an advocate;
he was very eloquent and successful in pleading the cause
of his clients before the judge and jury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the year 1823 he was elected judge of the Superior
Court of Ohio. He continued in this high position till
June 20th, 1829. Could you have stood in the court
room on that early summer day, you would have seen the
fine intelligent face of the judge suddenly grow pale, followed
by an expression of suffering. The eyes of the
“gentlemen of the bar,” and of citizens present, are
turned with anxious interest toward him. Soon after, he
is compelled to leave the bench and remove to his private
apartment, where he rapidly sinks into the embrace of
death. His disease was supposed to be that fatal scourge
of eastern lands and our own—the cholera. Probably
my young reader was not born when it spread terror
through nearly all the cities of our Union. In 1840 his
remains were removed to Lancaster, Ohio. Should you
become a western lawyer, you may have occasion to
consult his decisions, contained in the first three volumes
of the Ohio Reports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This gifted, highly educated and popular judge left a
widow with eleven children. She was a devoted wife and
mother, and a communicant in the Presbyterian Church.
Charles T., the eldest, is now a successful lawyer in
Washington, D. C.; the next in order was Mary Elizabeth;
the third, James; the fourth, Amelia; the fifth,
Julia; and the sixth, William Tecumseh, our hero.
After him were L. Parker, John, the able and loyal
senator from Ohio, who was born May 10th, 1823; and
after him were Susan D. Hoyt and Frances B.</p>

<p class='pindent'>William Tecumseh was born February 8th, 1820. It
was quite difficult to decide upon a name for the boy.
“What shall we call him?” was the topic of much domestic
chat. Two or three favorite names were suggested
and discussed, but still the child was nameless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day the father, who had seen the Indian chieftain
Tecumseh, and admired that really great man, came in
and said, “I have the name of a better man than either we
have mentioned.” The eye and ear of those around the
cradle were turned to know whom he could be. The bright
boy only seemed to have no interest in the matter. “<span class='it'>Tecumseh</span>,
we will name him,” was the almost startling announcement.
It was softened down to the tone of civilized
life by the addition of William. The further reason for the
selection of a warrior’s name who fought for the English,
I will tell you, as I did the story of “Ulysses S. Grant,”
now his lieutenant-general, in the language of another
who wrote me on the subject: “Tecumseh, the celebrated
chief and warrior of the Shawanoese tribe, who was killed
at the battle of the Thames, October 5th, 1813, was for
a long time kept in rather fond remembrance in this immediate
vicinity, by those who were engaged in that conflict,
of whom Captain Sanderson is still a resident here;
because they knew that several times he prevented the
shedding of innocent blood. This fact, with the desire
of Mr. Sherman to have one son educated for military
life, led him to choose Tecumseh for the boy, he being
born not long after the death of that chieftain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tecumthé, or as it is written Tecumseh, a Shawanoese
Indian, was born in Piqua, since called West Boston, on
Mad River, in Clarke County, Ohio. Tecumseh’s grandmother
was the daughter of a Southern English colonial
governor, who fancied the handsome young Creek, and
married him. Their only son took for his wife a Shawanese
woman, who gave birth to Tecumseh while on
a journey from the southern to the western hunting
grounds. A few years later three more sons were born
at the same time, one of whom, Tenskwautawaw, became
the famous prophet who was the artful and unprincipled
instrument of his brother, Tecumseh, in his great lifework,
which was to arouse and unite the western tribes
in the last determined effort to drive and keep their white
neighbors from the valley of the Mississippi. While a
boy, his splendid genius gave him the leadership among
his playmates, and he “was in the habit of arranging
them in parties for the purpose of fighting sham battles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When about fifteen years old, he was so shocked at
the scene then common among the Indians—burning
prisoners at the stake—that he determined to give his
voice against the horrid custom. The young reformer
first displayed his commanding eloquence in his bold condemnation
of the practice, which through his powerful
influence gradually disappeared. He advocated total
abstinence from ardent spirits, the principal source of
savage degradation and destruction, and urged his people
to drop all superfluous ornaments, and abstain from the
use of articles sold by the traders. Like his illustrious
namesake, our hero, he was mighty in speech as well as
in the battle-field. I will give in illustration a brief address
made August 12th, 1810, to Governor Harrison,
whom he met in council at Vincennes, on the Wabash
River. The fine words and grand views of the warrior,
will make you think of our own Tecumseh marching
over the very country from which the ancestors of the
Shawanoese came:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have made myself what I am; and I would that
I could make the red people as great as the conceptions
of my mind, when I think of the Great Spirit that rules
over all. I would not then come to Governor Harrison
to ask him to tear the treaty; but I would say to him,
Brother, you have liberty to return to your own country.
Once there was no white man in all this country; then it
belonged to red men, children of the same parents, placed
on it by the Great Spirit to keep it, to travel over it, to
eat its fruits, and fill it with the same race—once a happy
race, but now made miserable by the white people, who
are never contented, but always encroaching. They have
driven us from the great salt water, forced us over the
mountains, and would shortly push us into the lakes; but
we are determined to go no further. The only way to
stop this evil is for all the red men to unite in claiming
a common and equal right in the land, as it was at first
and should be now—for it never was divided, and belongs
to all. No tribe has a right to sell, even to each other,
much less to strangers, who demand all, and will take no
less. The white people have no right to take the land
from the Indians, who had it first—it is theirs. They
may sell, but all must join. Any sale not made by all is
not good. The late sale is bad; it was made by a part
only. Part do not know how to sell. It requires all to
make a bargain for all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This upright, humane, and unequalled warrior, after
struggling in vain to save his declining race, fell gloriously
during the last war with England, in the battle of the
Thames, not many miles from Detroit, on the Canada side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His American namesake, by a singular course of
providential events, as you know and will read in the
record of his life more fully, became the greatest military
commander of the age, in the very region from which,
with his people, he emigrated to the West.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will now take you to the place of William Tecumseh’s
birth. Lancaster is in Fairfield County, Ohio, on
the Hockhocking River, twenty-eight miles east of Columbus,
the capital of the State. The valley is very beautiful.
It was the home of the Wyandots less than a
century ago, and was called Tarh or Crowtown, from the
name of the principal chief. His wigwam was on the
bank-border of a prairie, near a clear and living spring,
from whose gushing waters he slaked his thirst for many
years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1800 a Mr. Fane laid out Lancaster on Mount
Pleasant, called by the Indians, who at that time still
lingered there, “Standing-Stone,” because the summit
was formed of masses of sandstone. It was a place of
popular resort on account of the extensive and magnificent
views of the surrounding country. Duke Saxe Weimar,
who travelled in this country about forty years since,
carved his name on its rock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For several years after Lancaster was settled, the
people had a curious regulation, of which I must tell
you, and something like which would not be a bad arrangement
at the present day. Stumps of the forest trees
so lately there, were scattered along the streets; and when
a man was caught intoxicated, the penalty was, the <span class='it'>removal
of a stump</span>. The drunkards and the stumps both
were thinned out; for whenever a citizen went staggering
among the remnants of the primeval woods, he was
watched till sober enough to go to work, then set to digging
at the roots. Tipplers were careful to walk abroad
in straight lines; and if one failed to keep within the
limits of <span class='it'>temperate</span> drinking, he must take good exercise
at the stump, which was both a public exposure and a
blessing to the village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lancaster is now a handsome city, full of western activity,
and keeping step to the music—</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.9em;'>“Westward the star of empire takes its way.”</p>

<p class='noindent'>Such was and is the birthplace of William Tecumseh
Sherman.</p>

<div style="position:absolute;margin-left:-.5em; font-size:150%;">“</div><p class='noindent'><img src='images/m.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='M'/>OTHER, may I go and play in the sand?”
said a bright boy one day, cap in hand,
ready to bound into the open air. Almost
before the expected “yes” had ceased to
echo in the room, “Cump,” as he was
familiarly called, hastened to a bank in which excavations
had been made, and the sand taken away. He was soon
“busy as a bee,” throwing up miniature fortifications
and heaps in various forms, after the models of his own
juvenile invention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile the distinguished Hon. Thomas Ewing,
now the venerable representative of the statesmen of the
past, a resident of Lancaster, entered the widowed
mother’s dwelling. He knew that the benevolent and
departed father had not left her large family a fortune.
It would therefore be no easy task to educate and start
them in the world. And his errand there was to ask her
to commit one of the boys to his home and care. He
said, with a playful earnestness, “I must have the smartest
of the lot; I will take no other, and you must select
him for me.” After a short consultation between the
mother and eldest daughter, the choice fell upon “Cump.”
So it was decided that Mr. Ewing should take him to his
house and educate him with his own children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leaving the mother and sister saddened with the
prospect of parting with the boy, he went to the sandbank,
where we just now left William at play. “Come,
my boy,” said the unexpected visitor, “you are going to
live with me. I have seen your mother; she has given
her consent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The astonished little worker listened, and looked a moment
at his benefactor, then straightened up, brushed off
the sand, and started after him. That night he went to
his bed in his new and beautiful home with strange
thoughts, and a shadow upon his young spirit. He had
left mother and the home of his childhood for life; only
as an occasional visitor. It was a crisis in his history,
and one which decided in the result his brilliant martial
career. The public schools, which are now the pride of
our land, were not then known in Ohio. But Lancaster
could boast a good academy, and into its English department
Tecumseh was entered as a pupil. He had reached
his ninth year, and soon convinced his teacher and companions
that he could take a high rank among the boy-students
of his age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Ewing assured me that there was nothing remarkable
or eccentric in his experience during the years that
followed, excepting his executive ability in little matters of
business committed to him. He “never knew so young
a boy who would do an errand so correctly and promptly
as he did. He was transparently honest, faithful, and
reliable. Studious and correct in his habits, his progress
in education was steady and substantial.” At the age
of sixteen, Mr. Ewing, in his official position, had at
his disposal the appointment of a cadet to the Military
Academy at West Point, and determined to offer it to his
“<span class='it'>protégé</span>.” Tecumseh had a taste for military life, and
of course gladly accepted the honor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before we follow him to that institution we will take
another glimpse of the home of his adoption. Mrs.
Ewing was a highly intelligent lady, a member of the
Roman Catholic Church, and had the privilege of educating
her children in her own faith. Her daughter
Ellen was at this time an attractive girl of nearly the
same age of Tecumseh. For half a dozen of life’s most
careless, happy years, they had been to school, talked and
played together. And it is not strange that among the
friends he left behind him, when he turned the second
time from home, and now for a distant abode among
strangers, that to part with her should be no common
trial for his young and manly heart. But he had entered
for himself</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:.9em;'>“Upon life’s broad field of battle,”</p>

<p class='noindent'>and hastened to the ordeal of examination for admission
to the academy. The bright day of trial has come. Look
in upon the spacious hall where the Examining Board and
distinguished visitors have gathered, to see and hear what
the young candidates for freshman honors may know.
Now listen; young Sherman’s name is called. He is
modest, yet perfectly self-possessed. After answering a
test question with remarkable propriety and dignity, a
professor remarked: “He is a <span class='it'>blooded</span> fellow!” that is,
he was of good blood—had the <span class='it'>ingrained</span> qualities of
manliness, and the promise of honorable distinction.
This was in the summer of 1836. He advanced from
class to class, mastering the studies in the course, and
maintaining a high reputation in all his relations to the
officers and students of the academy. He was quite at
home in artillery, which you know is the handling of
heavy guns; and in the saddle at the riding school of the
institution. He graduated fifth in his class June 30th,
1840. The rebel General Beauregard was a classmate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You have learned that, as a man, he <span class='it'>loses no time</span> in
his military movements. Created second lieutenant in
the Third Artillery, he repaired to Florida in the service
of the regular army. When the autumnal leaves rustled
in the war-path, he was fairly in the ranks and under the
old flag, which he was destined to honor so well, and with
whose stars his name would shine while it floats over the
land of his birth.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/w.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='W'/>HEN Lieutenant Sherman reached the Southern
peninsula, our war with the “exiles” and
Seminoles had been in progress about five
years. “Who were the ‘exiles?’ ” you ask.
In answering that question I shall give you
some account of the Florida wars, in which many of our
West Point graduates have been actors; among them
Generals Grant, Mitchel, and Sherman. And I shall let
a distinguished statesmen, who has recently died,<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> and
who wrote a book about the “exiles,” tell you some interesting
things concerning these people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Florida was originally settled by Spaniards in 1558.
They were the first people to engage in the African slave
trade, and sought to supply other nations with servants
from the coast of Guinea. The colonists held many
slaves, expecting to accumulate wealth by the unrequited
toil of their fellow-men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Carolina, by her first and second charters, claimed a
vast extent of country, embracing St. Augustine and most
of Florida. Here was the first occasion for hostilities, the
conflicting claims to jurisdiction, of the Spaniards and the
colonies. The Carolinians also held many slaves. Profiting
by the labor of their servants, the people sought to
increase their wealth by enslaving the Indians who resided
in their vicinity. Hence in the early slave codes
of that colony we find reference to ‘negro and <span class='it'>other</span>
slaves.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the boundaries of Florida and South Carolina
became established, the colonists found themselves separated
by the territory now constituting the State of
Georgia, at that time mostly occupied by the Creek
Indians. The efforts of the Carolinians to enslave the
Indians brought with them the natural and appropriate
penalties. The Indians soon began to make their escape
from service to the Indian country. This example was
soon followed by the African slaves, who also fled to the
Indian country, and, in order to secure themselves from
pursuit, continued their journey into Florida.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are unable to fix the precise time when the persons
thus exiled constituted a separate community. Their
numbers had become so great in 1736 that they were
formed into companies, and relied on by the Floridians as
allies to aid in the defence of that territory. They were
also permitted to occupy lands upon the same terms that
were granted to the citizens of Spain; indeed, they in all
respects became free subjects of the Spanish crown.
Probably to this early and steady policy of the Spanish
Government, we may attribute the establishment and
continuance of this community of ‘exiles’ in that territory.
A messenger was sent by the Colonial Government of
South Carolina to demand the return of those fugitive
slaves who had found an asylum in Florida. The demand
was made upon the Governor of St. Augustine,
but was promptly rejected. This was the commencement
of a controversy which has continued for more than
a century, involving our nation in a vast expenditure of
blood and treasure, and it yet remains undetermined.
The constant escape of slaves, and the difficulties resulting
therefrom, constituted the principal object for establishing
a free colony between South Carolina and Florida,
which was called Georgia. It was thought that this
colony, being free, could afford the planters of Carolina
protection against the further escape of their slaves from
service. These ‘exiles’ were by the Creek Indians called
‘Seminoles,’ which in their dialect signifies ‘runaways,’
and the term being frequently used while conversing
with the Indians, came into almost constant
practice among the whites; and although it has now
come to be applied to a certain tribe of Indians, yet it was
originally used in reference to these ‘exiles’ long before
the Seminole Indians had separated from the Creeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These “exiles,” once slaves, had settled in rich valleys,
and had their flocks, and herds, and children around
them. The great State of Georgia did not like to see
this paradise of escaped bondmen prosper. Indeed, she
looked with covetous eye upon every foot of Indian territory
within her limits, and seems to have early decided,
with or without the national sanction and help, to take
possession of the “exiles,” and of the lands belonging to
the Aborigines. The first thing was to get Florida from
Spain, then seize the “exiles.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such influences were brought to bear upon Congress,
that in <span class='it'>secret</span> session a law was passed in 1811 to wrest
the territory from the authority of Spain. And now
commenced the invasion of that country by the most
desperate men. It was like the outrage upon “bleeding
Kansas” since.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Seminoles had refused to surrender the “exiles,”
and the Georgians determined to exterminate them.
This injustice and cruelty opened the <span class='it'>first</span> war with the
Seminoles. Hostilities continued for many years, attended
with deeds of savage heroism, scenes of horror
and of death, till many an American soldier found a
grave in the gloomy everglade and dark river channel.
At length there was a pause in the terrible border warfare.
Outrages by the white people continued, “exiles”
were captured, treaties broken, and the effort renewed to
remove the Seminoles to the western territory. Upon
a certain day when a consultation was held over a speech
addressed by the Secretary of State, General Cass,
urging emigration, a youthful warrior, named “Osceola,”
since very famous, drew his burnished knife from his
belt, and said, while striking it into the table before him,
“<span class='it'>This is the only treaty I will ever make with the whites.</span>”
It was a threat of war again, soon realized. He was the
son of an Indian trader, a white man named Powell.
His mother was the daughter of a Seminole chief. He
had recently married a woman said to have been very
“beautiful.” She was the daughter of a chief who had
married one of the “exiles,” but as all colored people, by
slaveholding laws, are said to follow the condition of the
mother, she was called an African slave. Osceola was
proud of his ancestry. He hated slavery, and those who
practised the holding of slaves, with a bitterness that is
but little understood by those who have never witnessed
its revolting crimes. He visited Fort King in company
with his wife and a few friends, for the purpose of trading.
Mr. Thompson, the agent, was present, and while engaged
in business, the wife of Osceola was seized as a
slave. Evidently having negro blood in her veins, the
law pronounced her a slave; and, as no other person
could show title to her, the pirate who had got possession
of her body, was supposed, of course, to be her owner.
Osceola became frantic with rage, but was instantly
seized and placed in irons, while his wife was hurried
away to slaveholding pollution. He remained six days
in irons, when, General Thompson says, he became penitent,
and was released. From the moment when this
outrage was committed, the Florida War may be regarded
as commenced. Osceola swore vengeance upon
Thompson, and those who assisted in the perpetration of
this indignity upon himself, as well as upon his wife, and
upon our common humanity. The “exiles” endeavored to
stimulate the Indians to deeds of valor. In general
council they decreed that the first Seminole who should
make any movement preparatory to emigration, should
suffer death. Charley E. Mathlu, a respected chief, soon
after fell a victim to this decree. Osceola commanded
the party who slew him. He had sold a portion of his
cattle to the whites, for which he had received pay in
gold. This money was found upon his person when he
fell. Osceola forbade any one touching the gold, saying
it was the price of the red man’s blood, and with his own
hands he scattered it in different directions as far as he
was able to throw it. But his chief object appeared to
have been the death of General Thompson. Other
Indians and “exiles” were preparing for other important
operations, but Osceola seemed intent—his whole soul was
absorbed in devising some plan by which he could safely
reach Mr. Thompson, who was the object of his vengeance.
He, or some of his friends, kept constant watch
on the movements of Thompson, who was unconscious of
the danger to which he was exposed. Osceola, steady to
his purpose, refused to be diverted from this favorite object.
Thompson was at Fort King, and there were but
few troops to protect that fortress. But Indians seldom
attempt an escalade, and Osceola sought an opportunity
to take it by surprise. With some twenty followers he
lay secreted near the fort for days and weeks, determined
to find some opportunity to enter by the open gate, when
the troops should be off their guard. Near the close of
December, 1835, a runner brought him information that
Major Dade, with his command, was to leave Fort
Brooke on the twenty-fifth of that month, and that those
who intended to share in the attack upon that regiment,
must be at the great “Wahoo Swamp” by the evening of
the twenty-seventh. This had no effect whatever upon
Osceola. No circumstance could withdraw him from the
bloody purpose which filled his soul.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the twenty-eighth, in the afternoon, as he and his
followers lay near the road leading from the fort to the
house of the sutler, which was nearly a mile distant, they
saw Mr. Thompson and a friend approaching. That
gentleman and his companions had dined, and, on taking
their cigars, he and Lieutenant Smith, of the second artillery,
had sallied forth for a walk and to enjoy conversation
by themselves. At a signal given by Osceola, the
Indians fired. Thompson fell pierced by fourteen balls;
Smith received about as many. The shrill war-whoop followed
the sound of the rifles, and alarmed the people at
the fort. The Indians immediately scalped their victims,
and then hastened to the house where Mr. Rogers, the
sutler, and two clerks, were at dinner. These three persons
were instantly massacred and scalped. The Indians
took as many valuable goods as they could carry, and set
fire to the building. The smoke gave notice to those in
the fort of the fate that had befallen the sutler and his
clerks. But the condition in which the commandant
found his troops forbade his sending out any considerable
force to ascertain the fate of Thompson and his companion.
Near nightfall a few daring spirits proceeded
up the road to the hommock, and brought the bodies to
the fort, but Osceola and his followers had hastened their
flight, not from fear of the troops, but with the hope of
joining their companions at Wahoo in time to engage in
scenes of more general interest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The election campaign for President occurred the
very fall Lieutenant Sherman went to Florida. Martin
Van Buren was defeated, and there was no greater cause
of it than the continuance of the Florida war, wasting
precious life and treasure. You will be interested in the
story of Wild Cat’s daughter. He was the son of King
Philip, a Seminole chief, and became himself one of the
mighty leaders in the Indian struggle for existence. Not
far from the time young Sherman went to the field of
conflict, the daughter of Wild Cat, “an interesting girl
of twelve years of age, fell into the hands of our troops
in a skirmish near Fort Mellon. This was regarded as a
most fortunate circumstance, as it would be likely to procure
an interview with the father. Miceo, a sub-chief
and friend of Wild Cat, was despatched with a white flag,
on which were drawn clasped hands in token of friendship,
with a pipe and tobacco. He found Wild Cat, and
delivered the message of the commanding-general, requesting
an interview. Wild Cat agreed to come in, and
gave Miceo a bundle of sticks, denoting the days which
would elapse before he appeared in camp. Miceo returned
and made his report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the fifth of March Wild Cat was announced as
approaching the American camp with seven of his trusty
companions. He came boldly within the line of sentinels,
dressed in the most fantastic manner. He and his party
had shortly before killed a company of strolling theatrical
performers, near St. Augustine, and having possessed
themselves of the wardrobe of their victims, put it on.
He approached the tent of General Worth, calm and self-possessed,
and shook hands with the officers. He then
addressed the general without hesitation and with dignity,
saying he had received the talk and white flag sent him.
He had come according to invitation to visit the American
camp with peaceful intentions, relying upon his good
faith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At this moment his little daughter escaped from the
tent where she was to remain till General Worth should
think the proper time to present her to her father had
come. With the feelings and habits of her race, she gave
him musket balls and powder which she had managed to
obtain and secret until his arrival. On seeing his child
he could no longer command that dignity of bearing so
much the pride of every Indian chief. His self-possession
gave way to parental emotions; the feelings of the father
gushed forth; he averted his face and wept.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Having recovered his self-possession he addressed
General Worth, saying: ‘The whites dealt unjustly by
me. I came to them, when they deceived me. I loved
the land I was upon; my body is made of its sands. The
Great Spirit gave me legs to walk over it; eyes to see it;
hands to aid myself; a head with which I think. The
sun, which shines warm and bright, brings forth our
crops; and the moon brings back the spirits of our warriors,
our fathers, our wives and children. The white
man comes; he grows pale and sickly; why can we not
live in peace? They steal our horses and cattle, cheat
us, and take our lands. They may shoot us—may chain
our hands and feet, <span class='it'>but the red man’s heart will be free</span>.
I have come to you in peace, and have taken you all by
the hand. I will sleep in your camp, though your soldiers
stand around me thick as pine trees. I am done: when
we know each other better, I will say more.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“During the interview, Wild Cat spoke with great
sincerity; frankly stated the condition and feelings of his
people; stated the friendly attachment between the ‘exiles’
and Indians; said that they would not consent to be separated;
that nothing could be done until their annual
assemblage in June, to feast on the green corn; that, hard
as the fate was, he would consent to emigrate, and would
use his influence to induce his friends to do so. After remaining
four days in camp, he and his companions left,
accompanied by his little daughter, whom he presented to
her mother on reaching his own encampment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young Sherman was created first lieutenant November,
1841, and soon after the war closed, followed by the
removal of the “exiles” to the country beyond the State
of Arkansas, joining the Creeks there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are two very interesting facts you will think of
in this glimpse of the early experience of our cadet-soldier.
The first is, the real beginning of the great
rebellion, in the unjust and oppressive claims of the
Southern States upon other races, and upon our national
legislation. The other curious fact is the awful desolation
of that leading State in this wrong, Georgia, by the
lieutenant, more than a score of years afterwards, in the
defence of our own imperilled liberties.</p>

Lieutenant Sherman in Fort Moultrie—The Fortress—The Mexican War—He
goes to California—His Service there—Appointed Captain—His Marriage—Exciting
Scenes in California—In the Commissary Department—Resigns
his Commission—Turns Banker.
</div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/l.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='L'/>IEUTENANT SHERMAN was next ordered to
Fort Moultrie, on Sullivan’s Island, in Charleston
harbor. Do you know the origin of that fortress
and of its name? Six days before the Declaration
of Independence was signed, there was a
memorable battle and victory here, over the British
squadron commanded by Sir Peter Parker. A post had
been commenced, which, upon the appearance of the fleet
was hastily completed, under the command of General
Moultrie, a very brave officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Charles Lee, the commander-in-chief at this
post, urged Moultrie to abandon the works, because the
men-of-war would soon blow them to pieces. “Then we
will fight behind the ruins,” said the gallant leader of a
band, who answered his bold words with a “<span class='it'>hurrah!</span>”
The battle opened, and soon the American flag, which
was then a white crescent on a ground of blue, went
down. The spectators at a distance thought the post
had surrendered. But no—the flag-staff was shot off,
and Sergeant William Jasper leaped through the embrasure
of the wall, and seizing it, restored it to its place
on the battlements. He was a young hero, and his name
is among those of the daring defenders of the <span class='it'>first</span> banner
of the Revolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this fortress Lieutenant Sherman had an unexciting
round of duty. But more active service was near. If
you will turn to the map of the United States you will
see that the boundary between Texas and Mexico on the
south, runs northwesterly toward the Pacific Ocean,
where lies California, bounded on the southern side by
Mexico. When war followed the dispute between the
United States and the Mexican Government about the
dividing line, in 1846, it was necessary to have troops in
California. With the forces sent to that new and thinly-settled
region, Lieutenant Sherman went under the banner
he loved with all the enthusiasm of his ardent nature.
The fighting was principally done, you know, at Palo
Alto, Resaca de la Palma, Monterey, Molino del Rey,
and a few other points far from the post of Sherman.
But he did his duty in the ranks of the frontier-guard,
and was off on recruiting service when those fierce battles
were fought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>California had been for many years under the Government
of Mexico. The people rebelled against Santa
Anna, asserted their independence, but again submitted
to the old authority. In 1842 its rich plains attracted
emigration from all lands, which increased rapidly till
war with Mexico was declared. General Fremont was
there. A quarrel began between the Mexican people and
the settlers. This was increased by the conflict of the
two nations, which resulted in our establishing a territorial
government. The whole was ceded to the United
States at the close of the war for $15,000,000, and became
a State in 1850. With the flood of population from
many countries, before and after Lieutenant Sherman went
there, lawlessness of all kinds prevailed. Gambling was a
common business, incendiarism equally so, and justice was
almost unknown, even in the Government. Men were
shot in open day for giving offence; the people became
alarmed, and appointed a vigilance committee, who took
law into their own hands. Our still youthful officer opposed
such assumption of power, believing in redress for
wrongs through the constitutional remedies. And often
since the civil war commenced has he beguiled the weary
hours of camp-life by recounting the exciting scenes of
those wild days of California life. He saw a calmer period
of history there. The vigilance committee at length surrendered
its power to the State Government, and California
has taken her place among the noblest of our commonwealths,
loyal to the flag in the darkest hour of
strife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>California gold! You have heard of the mania for
the mines it created all over our land when the boy now
sixteen was in his cradle. But you may not know what
a chance to make a fortune Lieutenant Sherman had in
that territory—that he saw the small <span class='it'>beginning</span> of the
excitement. He was dining, February 8th, 1848, with
Captain Sutter, of Sacramento, who was building a saw-mill.
The workmen opened a sluice to wash out the
“tail-race,” when lo! there was gold in the sand. A
specimen was brought into the room where the officers sat,
and pronounced to be the precious particles, which have
since attracted the fortune-hunters of every land under
the sun. But the lieutenant quietly returned to his post,
and left to others the great discovery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rough experiences in southern and western forests—watching
the stealthy Indians, and riding through perilous
and difficult paths—were fitting him for work which
would attract the admiring interest of the world. So
well did he improve his opportunities to serve his country
and perfect himself in military science, that his farther
promotion to a captaincy was ordered while on the Pacific
coast. The war closed in the winter of 1848, and the
treaty of peace was signed in February of that year.
The life of a “regular” in the army became monotonous.
Garrisons and surveys occupied the troops. But there
came, two years later, an interesting change in the social
relations of Captain Sherman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The friend he left with so much regret when he bade
adieu to Lancaster, Ohio, for a home at West Point, Miss
Ellen B. Ewing, attracted the gallant young soldier’s
steps from the round of martial duty. In the spring of
1850 he led her to the altar of marriage, in Washington,
D. C., where the bride’s father, the Hon. Thomas Ewing,
has spent much of his long life in Congress, and in the
Cabinet. Two of the greatest statesmen in this or any
other nation, Daniel Webster and Henry Clay, were
guests on the occasion, also General Zachary Taylor.
Not many weddings in the Republic can boast of so many
distinguished persons among the spectators of the ceremonies,
offering their congratulations to the happy pair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Sherman was for a period connected with the
Commissary Department of the Army. Its duties are
the furnishing of the various supplies for the troops.
Tired of the quiet and tameness of the service, in 1853
he resigned his commission, and retired to private life.
That well-known and wealthy citizen of St. Louis, Mr.
Lucas, proposed to establish a banking-house in San
Francisco, under the name of “Lucas, Turner &amp; Co.,”
at the head of which was placed Captain Sherman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have come to a singular turn in his history.
The cadet has been from the Florida swamps to the
mountains of the northern border, rising in position,
and steadily, honorably pursuing the object immediately
before him, till tired of an almost useless existence, as it
seems, in the army, he is at length a gentlemanly banker
in the principal city of the “golden coast.” Days, weeks,
months, and years, find him in the comparatively quiet
round of business affairs. He is at home in the material
condition and politics of the country; for he is familiar
always with the current events of the times. The faithful
boy at errands, is the trusty soldier and banker also. No
stain rests on the record of his success in life.</p>

<div class='summary'>
Takes charge of a Military Academy in Alexandria, Louisiana—He sees the
rising storm of Civil War—Resigns—A noble Letter—He repairs to St. Louis,
and superintends a Street Railroad.
</div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/c.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='C'/>APTAIN SHERMAN, of the house of Lucas,
Turner &amp; Co., was not unsuccessful in the
banking-office; but it was not suited to his culture
and taste, and he was without large capital.
It is not strange, therefore, that when, in 1860,
he was offered the presidency of the Louisiana State Military
Academy at Alexandria, on a salary of five thousand
dollars per annum, he should accept the honorable position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You know that, besides the national institution for
discipline in the art of war, there are smaller schools of a
similar character in several of the States, besides private
enterprises of great merit. The Academy at Alexandria
was organized in 1860, and, intended to accommodate two
hundred cadets. Whether the State had reference to the
possibility of a collision with the Government in this
preparatory work we do not know, but are sure that
the chief officer had no thought of serving the cause of
revolt in taking its management. The town is situated on
the Red River, nearly in the centre of the State, three hundred
and fifty miles from New Orleans, which lies southeast
of it, and down the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Louisiana is a great cotton-growing State, and Alexandria
is in one of the richest portions of the wide plains
skirting the stream which poured its flood into the magnificent
tide of the “Father of Waters.” It is beautifully
situated in the midst of cotton plantations, which, like
snow-fields in summer, spread away in every direction
from the village. Here the professor was directing his
genius and attainments to carry out the wishes of the
founders of the school, when the first ominous sounds of
rebellion followed the election of Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew the Southern feeling well. The intercourse
with the people of the cotton States, from the association
at West Point with their sons to that hour, convinced
him of what we at the North were slow to believe, that
they were determined to have their own way or <span class='it'>fight</span>.
His clear judgment and forecast caught the signal of revolution
in the stormy councils and secession resolutions
which succeeded the political revolution. The evil spirit
of rebellion was in the very atmosphere about him.
There was hot blood, even in the recitation-rooms of the
Academy. The year 1860 closed over a purpose which
had slowly but steadily matured, to leave the institution
in which he had just begun to feel at home, and was fully
qualified to manage. It had cost him anxious thought.
But far in advance, as he has been ever since, in his views
of the true issue—the men and the measures we must
meet—he was sure a sanguinary struggle was at hand.
It saddened his heart, but nerved his strong hand to grasp
the starry banner and enter the arena of carnage and
victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus decided in his convictions and loyalty, he did
not wait for the thunder of cannon around Fort Sumter.
He wrote the following manly, strong, and patriotic letter,
which tells its own glorious story:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>January 18, 1861.</span></p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;'>“<span class='sc'>Gov. Thomas O. Moore, Baton Rouge, La.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>:—As I occupy a <span class='it'>quasi</span>-military position under
this State, I deem it proper to acquaint you that I accepted
such position when Louisiana was a State in the Union,
and when the motto of the seminary was inserted in marble
over the main door, ‘<span class='it'>By the liberality of the General
Government of the United States</span>: The Union—<span class='it'>Esto Perpètua</span>.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Recent events foreshadow a great change, and it becomes
all men to choose. If Louisiana withdraws from
the Federal Union, <span class='it'>I</span> prefer to maintain my allegiance to
the old Constitution as long as a fragment of it survives,
and my longer stay here would be wrong in every sense
of the word. In that event, I beg you will send or appoint
some authorized agent to take charge of the arms
and munitions of war here belonging to the State, or direct
me what disposition should be made of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And furthermore, as President of the Board of Supervisors,
I beg you to take immediate steps to relieve
me as superintendent the moment the State determines to
secede; for on no earthly account will I do any act, or
think any thought, hostile to or in defiance of the old
Government of the United States.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;'>“With great respect, &amp;c.,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“(Signed)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='sc'>W. T. Sherman</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>What a scorching rebuke is that in the first paragraph!
How sublimely loyal the sentiments of the last!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The resignation was accepted. The professor turned
his back upon his cadets and upon Louisiana, till he shall
return under the torn and blackened flag of conquest. Repairing
to St. Louis, he had no employment for his brain
or hands. But he was ready for any honest work. Mr.
Lucas, one of the millionaires of the city, offered him the
office of superintendent of a street railroad, on a salary
of two thousand dollars a year. He at once entered upon
its duties, without a regret that he had abandoned the
halls of military science and a larger reward for his
labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My young reader, it is a lesson for all ages and all
times. Embrace the providential openings for reputable
and useful labor, without regard to the present applause
or the favor of the busy multitude about you. Think of
the brave Captain—the educated instructor—managing
the affairs of a city horse-railway! Then think of the
host of young men, who would rather starve, or <span class='it'>gamble</span>, to
keep up the appearance of wealth and position, rather
than <span class='it'>go down</span> in the world’s estimate of what is respectable
and fashionable, and you will admire the truly heroic
character of the gifted Sherman.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/t.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='T'/>HE traitorous Secretary of War, John B. Floyd,
had not lost sight of the probable uprising of
the South at no distant period, for a moment,
during all of his official career. Every fort on
her soil was made an easy prey to her rebellious
hand by reducing their garrisons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The magnificent Fortress Monroe, on which the
United States had expended nearly two and a half millions,
could muster only eight companies of artillery.
The forts, Moultrie, Pinckney, and Sumter, of Charleston
harbor, had only eighty men, who were in Fort Moultrie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet, had you been in the Halls of Congress when
Mr. Clarke, of New Hampshire, offered a resolution of
inquiry into the condition of those defences, you would
have heard a storm of apparently virtuous indignation
from Jefferson Davis and his fellow-conspirators, as if
the intimation of treachery were an insult to Southern
chivalry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week later General Anderson and his band, loyal
to the national banner, having become assured that their
capture with Fort Moultrie was designed, after destroying
its equipment as far as possible, stole at dead of night
from its walls and floated over the waters to silent Sumter,
whose massive battlements promised a safer refuge
from the passions of infatuated men. The rebels immediately
seized Forts Moultrie and Pinckney; and ten days
later the Star of the West, an unarmed steamer conveying
a reënforcement of two hundred and fifty soldiers and
supplies for the destitute garrison, was fired upon from
newly-erected earthworks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The spring came with flowers and birds, but the
angry storm of rebellion beat around Sumter with increasing
fury. Iron-clad batteries had risen on every
hand to cut off the approach of our ships, and grim ordnance
now pointed toward the old fortress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>April 12th a messenger approached it with a very
brief message to Major Anderson; it was, “Surrender!”
The reply was nearly as short: “His sense of honor and
his obligations to the Government would prevent compliance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few hours after, and “boom! boom!” was the
sound, followed with shot and shell, against Sumter’s
walls, which opened a bloody civil war. In the iron hail
the fort was scarred, and its ground covered with exploding
shells. At length the band, one-third the number of
the famous warriors at Thermopylæ, against ten thousand,
saw the hopelessness of resistance, and made honorable
terms to themselves, of surrender. Every telegraphic
wire in the land, North and South, trembled to
the tidings of the battle hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hon. Thomas Ewing wrote Charles Taylor Sherman,
of Washington, the brother of William Tecumseh,
to use his influence to get the latter again into the army.
He felt that he was, and <span class='it'>would be</span> needed. The intelligent,
patriotic mind of the captain did not require <span class='it'>light</span>
for action, but only <span class='it'>opportunity</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our railroad superintendent at St. Louis thought that
all observant people must see that a terrible conflict had
begun, and like Grant in Galena, left his office to offer
his services to the Government, and his life, if that should
be the sacrifice, included in their acceptance. He hastened
to the nation’s capital. Soon after reaching Washington
he called on Secretary Cameron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Secretary, civil war is imminent, and we are
unprepared for it. I have come to offer my services to
the country in the struggle before us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think,” replies Mr. Cameron, “the ebullition of
feeling will soon subside, we shall not need many troops.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed the Secretary was quite surprised, if not annoyed,
at the earnestness of Captain Sherman. He next
sought an interview with the President, and made a similar
statement and offer to him. The good President was
inclined to take the whole thing as a joke. After listening
to the serious enthusiasm expressed in the strong appeal,
he replied, pleasantly: “We shall not need many
more like you; the whole affair will soon blow over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He left the Chief Magistrate of a republic whose very
existence he knew was assailed, with a shadow of disappointment
on his brave, loyal spirit—not for himself, but
for the cause near his heart. Friends then advised him
to go to Ohio and superintend the organization of three
months’ men there. He declared “it would be as wise
to undertake to extinguish the flames of a burning building
with a squirt gun, as to put down the rebellion with
three months’ troops.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To talk of any thing less than a gigantic war was to
him absurd. But he was then nearly alone in his just
estimate of the struggle.</p>

The Conflict Deepens—The Captain is made Colonel of the Thirteenth New York

</div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/i.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='I'/>NSTEAD of “blowing over,” the storm of rebellion
grew darker, and extended toward every point
of the horizon. The appointment of Captain Sherman
to an important command was discussed and
urged by those who knew him. And what do you
think he said? You recollect our Lieutenant-General,
when he asked the privilege of serving his country, declined
a generalship because too modest to aspire to its
honors. The lamented Major-General Mitchel desired
any place, however humble, where he might defend the
Stars and Stripes. And said the gallant Sherman: “I
do not wish a prominent place; this is to be a long and
bloody war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Real <span class='it'>ability</span> to achieve, and moral worth, are never
boastful and impatient to astonish the people. Even the
great rebel General Lee, in a letter recently published,
urges the same unassuming, calm performance of present
duty upon his son: quoting as an illustration the “old
Puritan,” who in the early period of our legislation, when
the day suddenly became outwardly dark, as if the sun
had disappeared from the heavens, causing a pause of
alarm, some fearing the judgment-day was at hand, called
for a light, saying he wished to proceed to business, and
be found at his post of duty when the final catastrophe
came. This is good counsel for us all, though from a
<span class='it'>rebel’s</span> pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General McDowell, who was then one of our most
popular commanders, seems to have had a just appreciation
of Sherman. He wanted his services; and on
the 13th of June, 1861, offered him the colonelcy of the
Thirteenth Infantry in the regular army, the command
dating May 14th of that year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A month of preparation for the field passed, and the
first great meeting of the opposing armies summoned him
to the war-path. July 16th, General McDowell, with
thirty-two thousand five hundred men, moved in four
divisions upon Manassas, through which lay the route to
Richmond, the capital of Virginia and of the Confederacy.
From Arlington Heights, Long Bridge, and Alexandria,
the troops marched proudly forward, anticipating
an early victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never before, my young reader, did a large army go
to the plain of carnage with hearts so light and gay—“as
if on a pic-nic excursion.” It was a splendid, and to
most of the troops a novel spectacle, that march upon the
“sacred soil” of the “Old Dominion,” to the animating
notes of “The Star Spangled Banner” and other national
airs. July 21st, the Sabbath day, the signals of battle
were seen in our lines, regardless of the hallowed time,
and confident of an almost bloodless conquest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Bowman, one of General Sherman’s officers
since, and a faithful friend, has given a clear and unvarnished
story of his part in the affray:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The enemy had planted a battery on Warrenton
turnpike, to command the passage of Bull Run, and
seized the stone bridge which crossed it, erecting a heavy
abatis to prevent our advance in that direction. The
object of the battle was to force this position, with a view
to subsequent operations beyond. The army engaged was
commanded by Brigadier-General McDowell. The fourth
division was left in the rear. The first, second, third, and
fifth were commanded respectively by Brigadier-General
Tyler, and Colonels Hunter, Heintzelman, and Miles. In
the plan of battle, Miles was to be in reserve on the Centreville
Ridge; Tyler was to advance directly in front of
Stone Bridge, on the Warrenton road, and cannonade the
enemy’s batteries; Hunter and Heintzelman were to move
to the right and cross the run above, and get to the enemy’s
rear. Colonel Sherman commanded the third brigade
in Tyler’s (first) division, consisting of troops since
renowned for gallantry—Captain Ayres’ Regular Battery,
the Thirteenth, Sixty-ninth, and Seventy-ninth New York,
and Second Wisconsin infantry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The advance was commenced on the morning of the
21st, and a part of Hunter’s and Heintzelman’s divisions,
according to McDowell’s official report, ‘forced the enemy
back far enough to allow Sherman’s and Keyes’s brigades
of Tyler’s division to cross from their position on the
Warrenton road. These drove the right of the enemy,
understood to have been commanded by Beauregard,
from the front of the field, and out of the detached woods,
and down the road, and across it, up the slopes, on the
other side.’ Pressing on, these two brigades, with the
two divisions on the right, came upon an elevated ridge
or table of land. Here was the severest fighting of the
famous battle. Sherman led his brigade directly up the
Warrenton road, and held his ground till the general
order came to retreat. It will be the verdict of history
that the fighting at Bull Run was no more disgraceful to
us than the unsuccessful fighting of the French at Waterloo.
It was the disorganized <span class='it'>rout</span> after the day was done
that showed that our army was as yet but an undisciplined
rabble. The day was lost partly by the delay in attack,
but chiefly by the arrival of reënforcements under Johnston,
when victory was already in our hands. General
Patterson was the Grouchy of our Waterloo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One fact in the battle has hitherto escaped comment.
The orders of Tyler’s division were to cross Bull Run,
when possible, and join Hunter on the right. This was
done, Sherman leading off, with the Sixty-ninth New
York in advance, and encountering a party of the enemy
retreating along a cluster of pines. Lieutenant-Colonel
Haggerty, of the Sixty-ninth, without orders, rode over
to intercept their retreat, and was shot dead by the
enemy. Furious at his loss, the Sixty-ninth sprang forward
and opened fire, which was returned. ‘But,’ says
Sherman, ‘determined to effect our junction with Hunter’s
division, I ordered the fire to cease, and we proceeded
with caution toward the field, where we then plainly
saw our forces engaged.’ Turning to Colonel Burnside’s
official report, we shall find that he was at this time overwhelmingly
pressed by the enemy. It was a critical
juncture. At length Major Sykes’s battalion of regulars
came up, and staggered the enemy, and at the same moment
Sherman came marching over the hill. ‘It was
Sherman’s brigade,’ says Burnside, ‘that arrived at about
twelve and a half o’clock, and by a most deadly fire assisted
in breaking the enemy’s lines.’ So much for soldierly
promptness and strict obedience to orders. From
the vigor with which Sherman fought his brigade, the
loss in his four regiments was one hundred and five
killed, two hundred and two wounded, two hundred and
ninety-three wounded or missing, with six killed and
three wounded in the battery, making a total of six hundred
and nine, the whole division losing eight hundred
and fifty-nine. The loss of the army, excluding prisoners
and stragglers, was computed thus: killed, four hundred
and seventy-nine; wounded, eleven hundred and eleven;
total killed and wounded, fifteen hundred and ninety.
When the conduct of Sherman had become known, the
Ohio delegation in Congress unanimously urged his immediate
promotion. This was easily effected, and on the
3d of August, 1861, he was confirmed a brigadier-general
of volunteers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Sherman’s brigade was the only one which
retired from the field in order, making a stand at the
bridge on the track to Washington, to dispute bravely
“the right of way,” should the enemy pursue our panic-stricken
forces toward the capital.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII.</h1></div>

<div class='summary'>
General Sherman goes to Kentucky—Muldraugh’s Hill—His army weakened—General
Buckner’s superior force—Succeeds General Anderson—Writes
General McClellan—Interview with Secretary Cameron—Paducah.
</div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/a.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='A'/>WAY on the borders of Kentucky the tramp of
war was heard. The hero of Sumter, General
Anderson, was in command of the department.
With the advent of autumn, the Union Home
Guards of Kentucky, with other troops, had
gathered to the banks of the Rolling Fork of Salt River—a
branch two hundred feet wide and only three feet
deep. Two miles from the road crossing lie the Muldraugh’s
Hills, rising in romantic outline. Half way
upon the ascent runs the railroad, whose bridge is
trestle-work ninety feet high; it then enters Tunnel Hill,
emerging into an open plain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Buckner, the rebel commander, was at Bowling
Green, looking toward Louisville, where he boasted
he would spend the winter. General Sherman was sent
to join General Anderson, the second in command, and
moved his force to Muldraugh’s Hills. Buckner had
burned the bridge; the Home Guards were withdrawn;
and the enemy’s troops numbered twenty-five thousand.
To retire to Elizabethtown with the five thousand Union
soldiers was the best that General Sherman could do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this crisis General Anderson resigned his command
on account of ill health, and the mantle of authority fell
on General Sherman; no very desirable honor at that
time, for “most of the fighting young men of Kentucky
had gone to join the rebels. The non-combatants were divided
in sentiment, and most of them far from friendly.
He lacked men, and most of those he had were poorly
armed. He lacked, also, means of transportation and
munitions of war; and if the rebel generals had known
his actual condition, they could have captured or driven
his forces across the Ohio in less than ten days. He applied
earnestly and persistently for reënforcements, and,
at the same time, took every possible precaution to
conceal his weakness from the enemy, as well as from
the loyal public. At that time newspaper reporters
were not always discreet, and often obtained and published
the very facts that should have been concealed.
He issued a stringent order excluding all reporters and
correspondents from his lines. This brought down upon
him the indignation of the press. More unfortunately
still, he failed to impress the Secretary of War with the
necessities of his position and the importance of holding
it. On the 3d of November he telegraphed to General
McClellan the condition of affairs, with the number of his
several forces, showing them to be everywhere, except at
one single point, outnumbered, and concluded his despatch
with the emphatic remark, ‘Our forces are too small to
do good, and too large to be sacrificed.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In reply, General McClellan asks, ‘How long could
McCook keep Buckner out of Louisville, holding the railroad,
with power to destroy it inch by inch?’—giving no
hint of a purpose to send reënforcements, but looking to
the probable abandonment of Kentucky. Previous to this,
General Sherman had had an interview with Secretary
Cameron, in presence of Adjutant-General Thomas, at
Lexington, Kentucky, and fully explained to him the situation
of his command, and also of the armies opposed
to him; and, on being asked what force was necessary for
a successful forward movement in his department, answered,
‘Two hundred thousand men.’ By the 1st of
November, Adjutant-General Thomas’s official report of
this conversation, in all its details, was published in most
of the newspapers of the country, giving the enemy full
knowledge of many important facts relating to General
Sherman’s department. He was too weak to defend his
lines; and the enemy knew it. He had no hope of reënforcements,
and, withal, was evidently in discredit with
the War Department, as being too apprehensive of the
power, strength, and resources of the enemy. He, therefore,
felt he could not successfully conduct the campaign,
and asked to be relieved. He was succeeded by General
Buell, who was at once reënforced, and enabled to hold
his defensive positions until Grant, the following spring,
should advance down the Mississippi and up the Cumberland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Sherman was now set down as ‘crazy,’ and
quietly retired to the command of Benton Barracks, near
St. Louis. The evidence of his insanity was his answer
to the Secretary of War—<span class='it'>that to make a successful advance
against the enemy, then strongly posted at all strategic points
from the Mississippi to Cumberland Gap, would require an
army two hundred thousand strong</span>! The answer was the
inspiration or the judgment of a military genius; but to
the mind of Mr. Secretary Cameron it was the prophecy
of a false wizard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has been said of the Spaniards, ‘that they generally
managed to have an army when they had no
general, and a general when they had no army;’ and
during the first years of the war we surpassed in folly
their example. It was vainly expected the rebellion
could effectually be put down without either a general
or an army, by a mere flourish of trumpets—as if the
foundations of the Confederacy, like the walls of Jericho,
would yield and fall at the blowing of a ram’s horn. Subsequent
events have sufficiently vindicated General Sherman’s
opinion expressed in his reply to the Secretary of
War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meantime General Halleck succeeded to the command
of the Department of the West, and General Sherman
was not long allowed to remain in charge of a recruiting-rendezvous
at St. Louis. When General Grant
moved on Fort Donelson, Sherman was intrusted with
the forwarding to him of reënforcements and supplies
from Paducah. General Grant subsequently acknowleged
himself ‘greatly indebted for his promptness’
in discharging that duty. After the capture of that
stronghold, General Sherman was put in command of
the fifth division of Grant’s army at Pittsburg Landing.
At the same time Beauregard was industriously
collecting the rebel forces at Corinth, a strong strategic
point, well fortified, thirty miles distant. Grant had
moved up from Fort Donelson, and Buell was on his
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>How grandly General Grant and Commodore Foote
did their work at Forts Henry and Donelson! What
deeds of valor were performed by our Western boys,
whose couch at night was the snowy earth, reddened with
the blood of carnage!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But while that storm of conflict was raging, an officer
who had no superior, and longed to enter its perils
and glory for his native land and his own loyal West,
was patiently, and “without observation,” sending, with
an intelligent appreciation of what was needed, and remarkable
promptness, supplies for the heroes of the great
border battles. General Grant <span class='it'>knew</span> the value of that
service, and warmly expressed in his despatches his
“indebtedness to General Sherman” for his activity, his
timely and indispensable aid, apart from the bloody field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My reader will recollect that the fall of Fort Donelson,
about the middle of February, 1862, startled the
whole of “rebeldom.” The strongest fortress in the
West was taken. The next position in importance was
Corinth, because at the junction of the Memphis and
Charleston and the Mobile and Ohio Railroads. Memphis,
the enemy knew, must soon be the prize for which
our victorious troops would strike.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Corinth must be defended!” was the cry from the
South. General Beauregard, the hero of Sumter and
Bull Run, hastened to the field of conflict, to lend the
power of his name and generalship to the cause of
treason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Grant had moved the gunboats after the surrender
of Fort Donelson down the Cumberland and up
the Tennessee River to Pittsburg Landing, making Savannah,
ten miles distant, his own headquarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Buell, with the Army of the Ohio, was marching
toward this point to join him, from the pursuit of
General Johnston through Nashville. The rebel officers
decided to concentrate their forces, by the railroads in
their possession, unexpectedly upon the Union army before
Buell could get there, and after annihilating it, turn upon
him and scatter his battalions. The enemy kept his
counsels well, while preparing to hurl his legions upon
our columns.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/p.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='P'/>ITTSBURG is the nearest point to Corinth on
the river, three miles from which, in the sparsely
settled country, is the old log building called
Shiloh Church—a dilapidated sanctuary of primitive,
or rather <span class='it'>backwoods</span> style. Around this
desolate place of former worship lay General Sherman’s
division, bordering both sides of the lower road to
Corinth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sunday morning, April 6th, the fifty thousand men
or more, under such leaders as Beauregard, Johnston,
Breckinridge, and Polk, fell upon the army of the Republic,
emerging from their forest paths like spectres in
the early light. “Carleton,” who was there, and carefully
went over the field of conflict to know all that was
done, thus notices our hero:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sherman’s pickets were being driven back by the
rapid advance of the rebel lines. It was a little past sun-rise
when they came in, breathless, with startling accounts
that the entire rebel army was at their heels. The officers
were not out of bed. The soldiers were just stirring,
rubbing their eyes, putting on their boots, washing at the
brook, or tending their camp kettles. Their guns were
in their tents; they had a small supply of ammunition.
It was a complete surprise. Officers jumped from their
beds, tore open the tent-flies, and stood in undress to see
what it was all about. The rebel pickets rushed up within
close musket range and fired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Fall in! Form a line! here, quick!’ were the
orders from the officers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was running in every direction. Soldiers for
their guns, officers for their sabres, artillerists to their
pieces, teamsters to their horses. There was hot haste,
and a great hurly-burly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Hardee made a mistake at the outset. Instead
of rushing up with a bayonet charge upon Sherman’s
camp, and routing his unformed brigades in an instant,
as he might have done, he unlimbered his batteries and
opened fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the alarm was given General Sherman was
instantly on his horse. He sent a request to McClernand
to support Hilderbrand. He also sent word to Prentiss
that the enemy were in front, but Prentiss had already
made the discovery, and was contending with all his
might against the avalanche rolling upon him from the
ridge south of his position. He sent word to Hurlbut
that a force was needed in the gap between the church
and Prentiss. He was everywhere present, dashing along
his lines, paying no attention to the constant fire aimed
at him and his staff by the rebel skirmishers, within short
musket range. They saw him, knew that he was an
officer of high rank, saw that he was bringing order out
of confusion, and tried to pick him off. While galloping
down to Hilderbrand, his orderly, Halliday, was killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sherman tried to hold his position by the church.
He considered it to be of the utmost importance. He did
not want to lose his camp. He exhibited great bravery.
His horse was shot, and he mounted another. That also
was killed, and he took a third, and, before night, lost his
fourth. He encouraged his men, not only by his words
but by his reckless daring. Captain Behr had been posted
on the Purdy road with his battery, and had had but little
part in the fight. He was falling back, closely followed
by Pond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Come into position out there on the right,’ said
Sherman, pointing to the place where he wanted him to
unlimber. Then came a volley from the woods. A shot
struck the captain from his horse. The drivers and gunners
became frightened and rode off with the caissons,
leaving five unspiked guns to fall into the hands of the
rebels! Sherman and Taylor, and other officers, by
their coolness, bravery, and daring, saved Buckland’s and
McDowell’s brigades from a panic; and thus, after four
hours of hard fighting, Sherman was obliged to leave his
camp and fall back behind McClernand, who now was
having, a fierce fight with the brigades which had pushed
in between Prentiss and Sherman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>You shall hear from the general’s fellow-officers about
his appearance and gallantry on this terrible field of strife.
A brave cavalry officer said of him: “Having occasion
to report personally to General Sherman, about noon of
the first day of Shiloh, I found him dismounted, his arm
in a sling, his hand bleeding, his horse dead, himself
covered with dust, his face besmeared with powder and
blood. He was giving directions at the moment to Major
Taylor, his chief of artillery, who had just brought a
battery into position. Mounted orderlies were coming
and going in haste; staff officers were making anxious
inquiries; everybody but himself seemed excited. The
battle was raging terrifically in every direction. Just
then there seemed to be universal commotion on our
right, where it was observed our men were giving back.
‘I was looking for that,’ said Sherman, ‘but I am ready
for them.’ His quick, sharp eye flashed, and his war-begrimed
face beamed with satisfaction. The enemy’s
packed columns now made their appearance, and as
quickly the guns which Sherman had so carefully placed
in position began to speak. The deadly effect on the
enemy was apparent. While Sherman was still managing
the artillery, Major Sanger, a staff officer, called
his attention to the fact that the enemy’s cavalry were
charging toward the battery. ‘Order up those two companies
of infantry,’ was the quick reply, and the general
coolly went on with his guns. The cavalry made a gallant
charge, but their horses carried back empty saddles.
The enemy was evidently foiled. Our men, gaining fresh
courage, rallied again, and for the first time that day the
enemy was held stubbornly in check. A moment more
and he fell back over the piles of his dead and wounded.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Rousseau, a division officer of Buell’s Army
of the Cumberland, speaks of him in the following handsome
manner:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He gave us our first lessons in the field in the face
of an enemy; and of all the men I ever saw he is the
most untiring, vigilant, and patient. No man that ever
lived could surpass him. His enemies say that he was
surprised at Shiloh. I tell you no. He was not surprised
nor whipped, for he fights by the week. Devoid
of ambition, incapable of envy, he is brave, gallant, and
just. At Shiloh his old legion met him just as the battle
was ended; and at the sight of him, placing their hats
upon their bayonets, gave him three cheers. It was a
touching and fitting compliment to the gallant chieftain.
I am thankful for this occasion to do justice to a brave,
honest, and knightly gentleman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor did he escape the attention of his commanding
officer. General Grant, in a letter to the War Department,
under date of July 25, 1863, said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the battle of Shiloh, on the last day, he held,
with raw troops, the key point of the landing. It is no
disparagement to any other officer to say that I do not
believe there was another division commander on the
field who had the skill and experience to have done it.
To his individual efforts I am indebted for the success of
that battle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Writes Colonel Bowman: “He formed his first line
of battle on the brow of a hill, or rather ridge, on the
west of Lick and Owl Creeks, which served as a natural
fortification. The men, by lying down or retiring a few
steps, were well covered, and, by rising and advancing a
few paces, could deliver their fire with terrible effect.
But his troops were mostly green, and wholly untrained
in the art of war. The rebel onset was well directed,
rapid, and most persistent. Some of Sherman’s regiments
broke and fled, while others fought like veterans.
The fight soon became general; Beauregard hurled his
massed columns with great impetuosity against our attenuated
lines, which, though yielding to the pressure,
did not break. The rebels gained ground inch by inch,
but could do no more than compress the semicircle of our
line of battle. Beauregard had promised his troops to
drive us into the Tennessee that day before three o’clock,
but nightfall found him contemplating the chances of
successful retreat; for Buell had arrived. Sherman’s
conduct on that day showed him to be a man of the first
order of military talent. He was not disconcerted by
the panic among his green troops, and, indeed, had expected
it. All he asked was, that a reasonable number
should remain and obey orders; and in an American
army there can always be found a goodly proportion of
officers and men incapable of being cowards under any
circumstances. With such he did battle on the 6th of
April, 1862—a day long to be remembered, as the
day of the battle of Shiloh. There was not a commanding
general on the field who did not rely on Sherman,
and look to him as our chief hope; and there is no question
that but for Sherman our army would have been destroyed.
He rode from place to place, directing his
men; he selected from time to time the positions for his
artillery; he dismounted and managed the guns; he sent
suggestions to commanders of divisions; he inspired everybody
with confidence; and yet it never occurred to him
that he had accomplished any thing worthy of remark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Nelson, a few days before his death, in conversation
with Larz Anderson and two or three other
gentlemen, said: “During eight hours, the fate of the
army on the field of Shiloh depended on the life of one
man: if General Sherman had fallen, the army would
have been captured or destroyed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Halleck, in his despatch to the Secretary of
War, recommending General Sherman for promotion,
said of him: “It is the unanimous opinion here that
Brigadier-General W. T. Sherman saved the fortunes of
the day on the 6th of April, and contributed largely to
the glorious victory of the 7th. He was in the thickest
of the fight on both days, having three horses killed under
him, and being wounded twice. I respectfully request
that he be made a major-general of volunteers, to
date from the 6th instant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Acting upon this recommendation, General Sherman
was promoted to the rank designated, to date from May
1st, 1862.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall give you now a letter of considerable length,
written by General Sherman himself about the battle.
Some of my readers may not care to read it all; but it
should have a place in the annals of his life, because it is
one of many illustrations of his power with the pen, and
is also his honest and truthful record of the great contest
at Pittsburg Landing:</p>

of sufficient importance to correct. To General Buell’s
noble, able, and gallant conduct you attribute the fact
that the disaster of April 6th, at Pittsburg Landing, was
retrieved, and made the victory of the following day.
As General Taylor is said in his later days to have
doubted whether he was at the battle of Buena Vista at
all, on account of the many things having transpired
there, according to the historians, which he did not see,
so I begin to doubt whether I was at the battle of Pittsburg
Landing of modern description. But I was at the
battles of April 6th and 7th, 1862. General Grant visited
my division in person about ten <span class='sc'>a. m.</span>, when the battle
raged fiercest. I was then on the right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After some general conversation, he remarked that
I was doing right in stubbornly opposing the progress of
the enemy; and, in answer to my inquiry as to cartridges,
told me he had anticipated their want, and given
orders accordingly; he then said his presence was more
needed over at the left. About two <span class='sc'>p. m.</span> on the 6th,
the enemy materially slackened his attack on me, and
about four <span class='sc'>p. m.</span> I deliberately made a new line behind
McArthur’s drill field, placing batteries on chosen ground,
repelled easily a cavalry attack, and watched the cautious
approach of the enemy’s infantry, that never dislodged
me there. I selected that line in advance of a bridge
across Snake Creek, by which we had all day been expecting
the approach of Lew. Wallace’s division from
Crump’s Landing. About five <span class='sc'>p. m.</span>, before the sun set,
General Grant came again to me, and, after hearing my
report of matters, explained to me the situation of affairs
on the left, which were not as favorable. Still the enemy
had failed to reach the landing of the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We agreed that the enemy had expended the <span class='it'>furore</span>
of his attack, and we estimated our loss, and approximated
our then strength, including Lew. Wallace’s fresh
division, expected each minute. He then ordered me to
get all things ready, and at daylight the next day to assume
the offensive. That was before General Buell had
arrived, but he was known to be near at hand. General
Buell’s troops took no essential part in the first day’s
fight, and Grant’s army, though collected together hastily,
green as militia, some regiments arriving without cartridges
even, and nearly all hearing the dread sound of
battle for the first time, had successfully withstood and
repelled the first day’s terrific onset of a superior enemy,
well commanded and well handled. I know I had orders
from General Grant to assume the offensive before I knew
General Buell was on the west side of the Tennessee. I
think General Buell, Colonel Fry, and others of General
Buell’s staff, rode up to where I was about sunset, about
the time General Grant was leaving me. General Buell
asked me many questions, and got of me a small map,
which I had made for my own use, and told me that by
daylight he could have eighteen thousand fresh men,
which I knew would settle the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understood Grant’s forces were to advance on the
right of the Corinth road and Buell’s on the left, and accordingly
at daylight I advanced my division by the flank,
the resistance being trivial, up to the very spot where the
day before the battle had been most severe, and then
waited till near noon for Buell’s troops to get up abreast,
when the entire line advanced and recovered all the
ground we had ever held. I know that with the exception
of one or two struggles, the fighting of April 7th was
easy as compared with that of April 6th.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never was disposed, nor am I now, to question
any thing done by General Buell and his army, and know
that, approaching our field of battle from the rear, he encountered
that sickening crowd of laggards and fugitives
that excited his contempt and that of his army, who never
gave full credit to those in the front line, who did fight
hard, who had, at two <span class='sc'>p. m.</span>, checked the enemy, and were
preparing the next day to assume the offensive. I remember
the fact the better from General Grant’s anecdote
of the Donelson battle, which he told me then for
the first time—that, at a certain period of the battle, he
saw that either side was ready to give way if the other
showed a bold front, and he determined to do that very
thing, to advance on the enemy, when, as he prognosticated,
the enemy surrendered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At four <span class='sc'>p. m.</span> of April 6th, he thought the appearances
the same, and he judged, with Lew. Wallace’s fresh
division, and such of our startled troops as had recovered
their equilibrium, he would be justified in dropping the
defensive and assuming the offensive in the morning.
And, I repeat, I received such orders before I knew
General Buell’s troops were at the river. I admit that I
was glad Buell was there, because I knew his troops were
older than ours, and better systematized and drilled, and
his arrival made that certain which before was uncertain.
I have heard this question much discussed, and must say
that the officers of Buell’s army dwelt too much on the
stampede of some of our raw troops, and gave us too
little credit for the fact that for one whole day, weakened
as we were by the absence of Buell’s army, long expected,
of Lew. Wallace’s division, only four miles off, and of
the fugitives from our ranks, we had beaten off our assailants
for the time. At the same time our Army of the
Tennessee have indulged in severe criticism at the slow
approach of that army which knew the danger that threatened
us from the concentrated armies of Johnston, Beauregard,
and Bragg, that lay at Corinth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In a war like this, where opportunities for personal
prowess are as plenty as blackberries, to those who seek
them at the front, all such criminations should be frowned
down; and were it not for the military character of your
journal, I would not venture to offer a correction to a
very popular error.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will also avail myself of this occasion to correct
another very common mistake in attributing to General
Grant the selection of that battle-field. It was chosen by
that veteran soldier, Major-General Charles F. Smith,
who ordered my division to disembark there, and strike
for the Charleston Railroad. This order was subsequently
modified by his ordering Hurlbut’s division to
disembark there, and mine higher up the Tennessee to
the mouth of Yellow Creek, to strike the railroad at
Burnsville. But floods prevented our reaching the railroad,
when General Smith ordered me in person also to
disembark at Pittsburg Landing, and take post well out,
so as to make plenty of room, with Snake and Lake
Creeks the flanks of a camp for the grand army of invasion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was General Smith who selected that field of
battle, and it was well chosen. On any other we surely
would have been overwhelmed, as both Lick and Snake
Creeks forced the enemy to confine his movements to a
direct front attack, which new troops are better qualified
to resist than where flanks are exposed to a real or chimerical
danger. Even the divisions of that army were
arranged in that camp by General Smith’s orders, my
division forming, as it were, the outlying pickets, whilst
McClernand’s and Prentiss’s were the real line-of-battle,
with W. H. L. Wallace in support of the right wing, and
Hurlbut on the left; Lew. Wallace’s division being detached.
All these subordinate dispositions were made by
the order of General Smith, before General Grant succeeded
him in the command of all the forces up the
Tennessee—headquarters, Savannah.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there were any error in putting that army on the
west side of the Tennessee, exposed to the superior force
of the enemy also assembling at Corinth, the mistake was
not General Grant’s; but there was no mistake. It was
necessary that a combat, fierce and bitter, to test the
manhood of the two armies, should come off, and that
was as good as any. It was not then a question of military
skill and strategy, but of courage and pluck, and I
am convinced that every life lost that day to us was
necessary; for otherwise at Corinth, at Memphis, at
Vicksburg, we would have found harder resistance, had
we not shown our enemies that, rude and untutored as
we then were, we could fight as well as they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Excuse so long a letter, which is very unusual for
me; but of course my life is liable to cease at any moment,
and I happen to be a witness to certain truths
which are now beginning to pass out of memory, and
form what is called history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I also take great pleasure in adding that nearly all
the new troops that at Shiloh drew from me official censure
have more than redeemed their good name; among
them that very regiment which first broke, the Fifty-third
Ohio, Colonel Appen. Under another leader, Colonel
Jones, it has shared every campaign and expedition of
mine since, is with me now, and can march, and bivouac,
and fight as well as the best regiment in this or any
army. Its reputation now is equal to that of any from
the State of Ohio.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/t.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='T'/>HE eighth of April dawned upon the silent, sanguinary
field of recent conflict. Soon large
companies of men were moving from the Union
camps with spades and other implements of
burial, to lay in trenches the heaps of the
slain. The weather was warm in that southern latitude,
and General Grant hastened the work of interment alike
of slaughtered friends and foes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Beauregard wrote to our commander, requesting
leave to take rebel bodies from our lines under flag
of truce; but other hands were completing the sad labor
for the disfigured, blood-stained, and pulseless warriors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Look away from that scene, after the battle, along the
Corinth road, and you see the serried files of living men,
led by the unresisting Sherman, dashing along in hot
pursuit of the enemy. The chief of the fifth division,
with a force of cavalry and two brigades of infantry, is
in the war-path again. Suddenly appear the white tents of
the abandoned camps of the enemy, and hospital flags are
flying over them in the early breeze. What does it mean?
They are <span class='it'>false</span> signals, hung out to deceive the pursuing
commander, and protect the deserted canvas cities. Onward
the sagacious, daring leader hurries after the foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now a shout rings from the lips of our “boys.”
The rebel cavalry are in sight. A few moments later
swords cross, pistols crack, and horses rush together in
the strife. Then the “graybacks” turn and fly, leaving
the field, camps, and all, to our victorious ranks. The
work of destruction followed. Tents, arms, ammunition,
were mingled in a common ruin. The road for miles
was lined with wagons the foe were compelled to leave
in their haste to get out of our way; ambulances stood
unused, although thousands of the mangled were in need
of them; limber-boxes, which belong to the guns, were
also abandoned; indeed, every thing showed a hurried
retreat, which but for the cavalry in the rear to cover the
flight of the infantry, would have been a complete rout of
the enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The victor returned from his gallant exploit only to
repeat it. The general advance toward Corinth immediately
followed. The fifth division swept over the country,
which was arrayed in vernal verdure and bloom.
The birds sang as sweetly as in any former spring-time,
startled beside the highway only by the tramp of the
marching host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May 17th the first shock came. The division of
General Grant’s army under Sherman, met the rebels in
a severe conflict on the road to Corinth. They had to
fall back before the human tide, crested with fire and
steel. This brief contest only opened the way to the
fortress of rebel strength. And the question was, how
shall Corinth be taken? It must either be by direct and
bloody assault, or by siege, surrounding it, and compelling
the imprisoned army to surrender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beauregard watched with sleepless vigilance his foe.
He ordered troops to intrench on a ridge near Philip’s
Creek and oppose the Union forces. General Jeff. C.
Davis approached the works; then, feigning a retreat,
drew the garrison out, when a severe struggle defeated
the enemy completely. This occurred May 21st; and,
on the 27th, General Sherman also had a fight with the
rebels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The decisive hour at length has come; all is activity
and excitement. We cannot furnish you a more vivid
description of the stirring and awfully sublime scenes of
such a crisis in army operations, than one given in a letter
from this field of conquest:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Regiments and artillery are placed in position, and,
generally, the cavalry is in advance; but when the opposing
forces are in close proximity, the infantry does the
work. The whole front is covered by a cloud of skirmishers,
then reserves formed, and then, in connection with
the main line, they advance. For a moment all is still
as the grave to those in the background; as the line
moves on, the eye is strained in vain to follow the skirmishers
as they creep silently forward; then, from some
point of the line, a single rifle rings through the forest,
sharp and clear, and, as if in echo, another answers it.
In a moment more the whole line resounds with the din
of arms. Here the fire is slow and steady, there it rattles
with fearful rapidity; and the whole is mingled with the
roar of the reserves as the skirmishers are at any part
driven in; and if, by reason of superior force, these
reserves fall back to the main force, then every nook and
corner seems full of sound. The batteries open their terrible
voices, and their shells sing horribly while winging
their flight, and their dull explosion speaks plainly of
death; their canister and grape go crashing through the
trees, rifles ring, the muskets roar, and the din is terrific.
Then the slackening of the fire denotes the withdrawing
of the one party, and the more distant picket firing that
the work was accomplished. The silence becomes almost
painful after such a scene as this, and no one can
conceive the effect who has not experienced it. The line
of works was selected, and, at the word of command,
three thousand men, with axes, spades, and picks, stepped
out into the open field from their cover in the woods. In
almost as short a time as it takes to tell it, the fence
rails which surrounded and divided three hundred farm
lots, were on the shoulders of the men, and on the way
to the intended line of works. Then, as, for a time, the
ditches deepen, the dirt is packed on the outer side,
the bushes and all points of concealment are cleared
from the front, and the centre divisions of our army has
taken a long stride toward the rebel works. The siege
guns are brought and placed in commanding positions.
A log-house furnishes the hewn and seasoned timber
for the platforms, and the plantation of a southern lord
has been thus speedily transformed into one of Uncle
Sam’s strongholds, where the Stars and Stripes float
proudly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Soon after daylight, on Friday morning, the army
was startled by rapid and long-continued explosions, similar
to musketry, but much louder. The conviction flashed
across my mind that the rebels were blowing up their
loose ammunition, and leaving. The dense smoke arising
in the direction of Corinth strengthened this belief, and
soon the whole army was advancing on a grand reconnaissance.
The distance through the woods was short,
and in a few minutes shouts arose from the rebel lines,
which told that our army was in their trenches. Regiment
after regiment pressed on, and passing through extensive
camps just vacated, soon reached Corinth, and
found half of it in flames.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The troops under General Sherman were first in the
works. Their columns, as we have seen, were conspicuous
in the entire and triumphant progress from Shiloh,
sustaining the heaviest blows, and bearing aloft proudly
the banner of the republic. General Sherman was in
subordinate command, but in his field of action he was
the uniformly wise, shrewd, daring, and successful leader.
Wrote General Grant: “His services as division commander
in the advance on Corinth, I will venture to say,
were appreciated by the new general-in-chief beyond any
other division commander.” He was appointed major-general
of volunteers, dating from May 1st, 1862.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Holly Springs, of which you will read more hereafter,
is situated on the railroad from Jackson, Tennessee, to
New Orleans. June 20th, General Sherman coolly relieved
the rebels of its care, and took possession himself,
burning long stretches of trestle-work on the Mississippi
Central Railroad, to prevent an unpleasant surprise by the
rebels. They had removed their machinery for making
and repairing arms to Atlanta, Georgia, not dreaming of
a visit to that city two years later by the division-general
at Holly Springs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few weeks after these events, July 11th, General
Halleck was ordered to Washington in the high position
of generalissimo of the Union armies, and a reorganization
of them followed. General Grant was placed in
command of the “Department of West Tennessee,”
covering a large territory bordering the Tennessee and
Mississippi Rivers. Memphis, which had surrendered
June 6th, was a very important base of operations and
supplies. But guerrillas and contraband traders infested
the country around, making the city a dangerous haunt of
traitors from the border-land. General Grant displayed
his wisdom in sending General Sherman to the post, declaring
that he could the most effectually restore order and
security to that disturbed district. Soon quiet reigned,
guerrillas disappeared, and villanous traders went to more
comfortable quarters. General Sherman did all and
more than General Grant expected of him. He was
just, humane, and yet severe in his administration,
according to his views freely and often expressed; that
when people appeal to war for the settlement of claims,
they must abide entirely by the rules and consequences
of so terrible a means of real or imaginary redress. His
ideas were comprehensive, and, had they prevailed at an
earlier period, our Government and commanders would
have ended the civil strife long ago, we cannot doubt.</p>

Courage—The Leader’s Heroism.
</div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/t.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='T'/>O secure the forces necessary for a new movement
against Vicksburg, General Grant requested
the War Department to reunite the thirteenth
and fifteenth corps with his own. Accordingly,
after the completion of the work of destruction
of rebel defences and munitions at Arkansas Post, the
troops reported to him at Memphis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The country was then excited over a quiet, and yet
startling act of the Chief Magistrate—one which would
be felt over the world, and through all ages—the Proclamation
of Emancipation! General Grant immediately
addressed himself to the enforcement of its provisions
within the limits of his command. Thousands wept for
joy; thousands more trembled or cursed with alarm
over the immortal document. Issuing his order in harmony
with it, he soon after removed a portion of his magnificent
army to Young’s Point, in Louisiana, and another
at Milliken’s Bend down the Mississippi River, taking
up his headquarters at the former place, where General
Sherman was also stationed with his troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was now a new device to get <span class='it'>around</span> Vicksburg,
and so open communication with forces below the
city. Canals were tried, but heavy rains, and the troops
being required to <span class='it'>fight</span> the floods rushing into camp
and excavations, compelled the commander-in-chief to
abandon the enterprise. Providence Lake and its connections,
and Yazoo Pass, were successively explored, and the
effort made to find a ship-path through the wild region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Admiral Porter had been looking along the shores of
the “Father of Waters,” to see if he could discover a
highway or <span class='it'>byway</span> for his gunboats. About the middle
of March, 1862, he told General Grant that he was
quite sure he could get through by Steele’s Bayou, Black
Bayou, to Duck Creek, thence to Deer Creek, into Rolling
Fork, and down Sunflower River into the Yazoo,
which empties into the Mississippi.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/bayous-illo.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0004' style='width:500px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>IN THE BAYOUS.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>General Grant and Admiral Porter proceeded on the
experimental excursion over these dark bayous. “And
what are they?” you may ask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bayou is a channel or outlet running from a river
to other waters—sometimes it is an old bed of the stream—forming
thus connections by which vessels can pass
from one stream to another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Grant returned to Young’s Point to send a
pioneer corps to cut away moss-covered trees overhanging
the waters, and obstructing the way. You can
scarcely imagine the awful gloom and solitude of those
tangled woods, whose drooping boughs and long plumes
of moss sweep the surface of the dismal bayous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Admiral Porter soon found that the enemy were on
his track, and might shut him into the wilderness. He
therefore sent to General Grant for troops. The ignorance
of the country, and the difficult winding way, gave
the rebels time to cut off the advance, and stop the bold
travellers just when near their journey’s end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Sherman now appears in the adventure, ordered
forward by his chief, to help the admiral out of
the perilous spot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The despatch from the Admiral having reached him
March 21st, that the channel was obstructed, and the
enemy six hundred strong, with field batteries disputing
his advance, General Sherman, with the promptness
and decision characteristic of his unsleeping martial
spirit, issued his orders to the troops. They made a
forced march, skirmishing part of the way, and reached
the gunboats before night of the 22d, a distance of
twenty-one miles, over a terrible road. But the brave
fellows had learned that General Sherman always had
a reason for his movements, and cheerfully advanced to the
rescue through exhausting trial and peril. “During the
day the enemy had been largely reënforced from the
Yazoo, and now unmasked some five thousand men—infantry,
cavalry, and artillery. The boats were surrounded
with rebels, who had cut down trees before and
behind them, were moving up artillery, and making every
exertion to cut off retreat and capture our boats. A
patrol was at once established for a distance of seven
miles along Deer Creek, behind the boats, with a chain
of sentinels outside of them, to prevent the felling of
trees. For a mile and a half to Rolling Fork, the creek
was full of obstructions. Heavy batteries were on its
bank, supported by a large force. To advance was impossible;
to retreat seemed almost hopeless. The gunboats
had their ports all closed, and preparations made
to resist boarders. The mortar boats were all ready for
fire and explosion. The army lines were so close to each
other that rebel officers wandered into our lines in the
dark, and were captured. It was the second night without
sleep aboard ship, and the infantry had marched
twenty-one miles without rest. But the faithful force,
with their energetic leader, kept successful watch and
ward over the boats and their valuable artillery. At 7
o’clock that morning, the 22d, General Sherman received
a despatch from the admiral, by the hands of a
faithful contraband who came along through the rebel
lines in the night, stating his perilous condition.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was now fairly shut up in the bayou by the rebels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The first firing of the gunboats was heard by
General Sherman near the Shelby plantation. He urged
his troops forward, and after an hour’s hard marching,
the advance, deployed as skirmishers, came upon a body
of the enemy who had passed by the force which had
been engaged. Immediately engaging them, the enemy
stood a while disconcerted by the unexpected attack,
fought a short time, and gave way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The next effort of the rebels was to pass around
our lines in the afternoon and night, and throw their
whole force still further below us; General Stuart, with
four regiments, marched on Hill’s plantation the same
morning, having run his transports in the night, and immediately
advanced one regiment up Deer Creek, and
another still further to the right. The rebels, who were
making a circuit about General Sherman, thus found the
whole line occupied, and abandoned the attempt to cut
off the gunboats for that day. During the afternoon the
troops and gunboats all arrived at Hill’s plantation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There were destroyed by our troops and by the
rebels at least two thousand bales of cotton, fifty thousand
bushels of corn, and the gins and houses of the plantations
whose owners had obstructed our progress, and joined in
the warfare. The resources of the country we found
ample to subsist the army at Vicksburg for some length
of time, and by the destruction of them we crippled the
enemy so far.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rescue of the admiral’s force was next thing to a
miracle: it was God’s kind and timely interposition. A
half hour’s delay in the movements of Generals Sherman
and Stuart, or of the second forced march of the former,
and all would have been lost. In the hands of a less
gifted and energetic leader, one of our bravest admirals,
with his fleet, would have been taken by the rebels, who
were confident of the prey and booty.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/b.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='B'/>EFORE following our brave commander further
in his war-path, let us survey the field of action
in the West. The goal of patriotic ambition was
now the “Gibraltar of the Father of Waters”—Vicksburg.
The great work of preparation to
move went forward during the autumn and early winter
under the eye of the patient, persistent Grant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>December 22d, 1862, he issued an order dividing the
troops into four army corps, stating that “the fifth division,
Brigadier-General Morgan L. Smith commanding, the
division from Helena, Arkansas, commanded by Brigadier-General
Steele, and the forces in the district of Memphis,
will constitute the fifteenth army corps, and be commanded
by Major-General W. T. Sherman.” Meanwhile, General
Sherman had been quietly put in command of his
forces, and ordered to sail for Friar’s Point, eighteen
miles below Helena, and be ready to coöperate with the
main body of troops under General Grant, in a combined
movement on the stronghold. The former had been in
the vicinity of the Tallahatchie River, making reconnaissances,
and was acquainted with that country by this personal
observation. He had issued an order of march
which showed no mercy to speculators, and, as you will
see, is marked with the clear thought and forcible words

<p class='pindent'>The columns of the three army corps had advanced
along the railroad leading from Grand Junction to Grenada,
the advance passing onward through Holly Springs
the last of November. By the middle of December General
Grant’s headquarters were at Oxford, his face set
toward Vicksburg. On the 20th occurred a painful and
memorable affair to check the forward march. Although
Gen. Grant had taken every precaution against raiding
parties, a dash was made at Holly Springs in his rear, held
by Colonel Murphy, who at once surrendered the post.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Grant was indignant at the cowardly surrender,
and immediately dismissed the unworthy officer from
the service. In consequence of the destruction of supplies,
the commander-in-chief had to fall back to Holly
Springs and prepare to start again. While this serious
interruption in the army’s progress was transpiring, General
Sherman had located his headquarters on board of
the <span class='it'>Forest Queen</span> with his staff. This magnificent fleet
consisted of one hundred and twenty-seven steamers besides
the gunboats. The troops were hardy, western men,
unsurpassed in the ranks for the qualities of brave
warriors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>War does not often present such a pageant as that of
this <span class='it'>armada</span> sailing down the Tennessee and then the
Mississippi Rivers. The Stars and Stripes waved over
the crowded decks, and music floated over the waters.
The grand procession of vessels moved majestically over
the broad current, which in the sunlight reflected their
forms, and in the evening unnumbered signal lanterns
from mast and prow and stern. Various were the scenes
and incidents of the voyage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Writes a passenger: “Until we got below Helena,
wood was so scarce on the river that it was only to be
obtained by cutting it, either entirely green or from the
water-logged drifts which had caught against the banks.
Wherever a good placer was discovered, the boats lucky
enough to find it landed and all hands went out with axes,
and in a few hours enough was obtained to steam on to
the next good place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the fleet approached Napoleon, Arkansas, the
<span class='it'>Post Boy</span>, which is a transportation boat, was in the advance,
and as she neared the shore she was hailed by a
person bearing a flag of truce, with the information that
there was a band of guerrillas just below, waiting to fire
upon her. At this time she was the only boat visible,
but in a short time the remainder of the fleet made its
appearance, and the guerrillas, if there were any, concluded,
no doubt, that we were too many for them. At
all events, at this point there was firing. The houses in
the town appeared to be nearly all deserted, but in some
of them could be seen persons standing back in the door,
as if to escape the observation of their neighbors, and
waving their handkerchiefs. Napoleon is the place where
the first shot was fired at a Federal steamer on the Mississippi
River, but there may be some Union people there
nevertheless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As we reached Helena, very little of the city could
be seen for the long line of tents stretched along the bank.
The fleet stopped there for the night and took on the troops
that were to accompany the expedition, and next morning
started on for Friar’s Point, the first place of rendezvous.
It lay there all night, and about nine o’clock next morning
again started down the river, and reached Gaines’ Landing,
one hundred and fifty miles below Helena, about two
o’clock <span class='sc'>p. m.</span>, where it stopped to wood. As the fleet approached
this point the bank appeared to be lined with
negroes, who all started down the shore hurrahing and
shouting and jumping, and cutting all kinds of antics. I
learned from some of them that they thought the fleet
was going down to set all the slaves free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the boats landed, a negro gave information
of a large store of wood of the best quality, amounting
to more than two thousand cords, secreted in the timber
near the bank, in a place where it would not readily have
been found. This was a great prize, and was instantly
levied on for the use of Uncle Sam. Every soldier able
to do duty was sent on shore to pack wood, and by nightfall
all the boats were well supplied for nearly the whole
trip. Near the wood were some ten or twelve houses,
one of them a very fine frame. The negroes said the
owners had gone to join the Southern army, and the soldiers,
without more ado, burned them all down. Many
of the negroes, if not all, came on the boats, and are now
under the protection of the army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At early light the next morning the fleet moved on
again, and as General Morgan’s division came opposite a
little village known as Wood Cottage Landing, some guerrillas,
secreted in a clump of undergrowth, fired a volley
at one of his transports. To teach them a lesson for the
future, General Morgan sent some troops on shore and
burnt every house in the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Milliken’s Bend was to be the last rendezvous of the
fleet before it started out for active operations on Vicksburg,
and we arrived there about dark on the evening of
the 24th December. The next day would be Christmas,
and many of the soldiers had the idea that the fleet would
sail right in without difficulty, and that they would take
their Christmas dinner in Vicksburg. Many invitations
were given among friends for a dinner at the Preston
House. They little dreamed of the disappointment in
store for them, or that New Year’s day would find them
on the wrong side of the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the night of the 24th, General Sherman sent out
a detachment of troops, under command of General M. L.
Smith, to tear up a section of the line of the Vicksburg
and Texas Railroad, about ten miles west of Vicksburg.
The work was well and quickly done, and the stations at
Delhi and Dallas burned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At daylight next morning all was ready, and the
fleet started for its destined port, which it reached on the
banks of the Yazoo about noon the same day. Many
years ago, about eight miles below the mouth of the
Yazoo, the Mississippi cut a new channel for itself across
a bend, coming into the main channel again just above
Vicksburg. The Yazoo followed the old channel, and
the mouth of the river is, therefore, really from twelve
to fifteen miles below where it was originally; but from
the old mouth to the new the river is known to pilots as
‘Old River.’ Where the fleet landed was about three
miles above Old River, where the right rested, and the
left extended to within three miles of Haynes’ Bluff, the
intervening space being about six miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On entering the Yazoo, the first object that attracted
the attention was the ruins of a large brick house and
several other buildings, which were still smoking. On
inquiry, I learned that this was the celebrated plantation
of the rebel General Albert Sidney Johnston, who was
killed at Shiloh. It was an extensive establishment, working
over three hundred negroes. It contained a large
steam sugar refinery, an extensive steam saw-mill, cotton-gins,
machine-shop, and a long line of negro quarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The dwelling was palatial in its proportions and
architecture, and the grounds around it were magnificently
laid out in alcoves, with arbors, trellises, groves of
evergreens, and extensive flower-beds. All was now a
mass of smouldering ruins. Our gunboats had gone up
there the day before, and a small battery planted near the
mansion announced itself by plugging away at one of the
iron-clads, and the marines went ashore after the gunboats
had silenced the battery, and burned and destroyed every
thing on the place. If any thing were wanting to complete
the desolate aspect of the place, it was to be found
in the sombre-hued pendant moss, peculiar to Southern
forests, and which gives the trees a funereal aspect, as if
they were all draped in mourning. As on almost every
Southern plantation, there were many deadened trees
standing about in the fields, from the limbs of all of which
long festoons of moss hung, swaying with a melancholy
motion in every breeze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The weather, since the starting out of the fleet, had,
up to this time, been very fine; but as evening now approached,
a heavy rain commenced, which, from the
appearance of things, bid fair to continue for an indefinite
period. The Yazoo River was low, and the banks
steep and about thirty feet high. Along the edge of the
water, and reaching to the foot of the bank, is a dense
undergrowth of willows, briers, thorns, vines, and live
oaks, twined together in a most disagreeably promiscuous
manner. To effect a landing of the troops and trains, a
way had to be cut through this entanglement, from every
boat, and this caused such a delay that it was quite dark
before all the troops were got on shore. Tents were
pitched for the night, pickets sent out, and the army encamped,
anxiously awaiting the dawn of the next day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That General Grant would fail to communicate with
him, General Sherman could not know. He carried out
his part of the great programme, and steadily advanced
in accordance with its provisions for united action. In
this profound ignorance of the occasion of the failure, he
prepared to move upon Vicksburg.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/o.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='O'/>N Saturday morning, December 27th, the advance
of the “right wing of the Army of the Tennessee”
reached Vicksburg. The approach to the
city from Johnston’s Landing was very difficult,
the town “being on a hill, with a line of hills
surrounding it at a distance of several miles, and extending
from Haines’ Bluff, on the Yazoo River, to Warrenton,
ten miles below, the city, on the Mississippi River.
The low country in the vicinity is swampy, filled with
sloughs, bayous, and lagoons; to approach Vicksburg
with a large force by this route, even in times of peace,
would be a matter of great difficulty, and with an enemy
in front, it was almost an impossibility.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The line of battle was soon formed by the army, and,
from different points, the onset made upon the enemy’s
works. Oh! how gallantly those Western legions beat
against the ramparts! And when the twilight shadows
stole over the bristling walls and hill-sides, they
had driven the rebel forces a mile from their original
position. Sunday dawned upon the night’s repose of the
combatants, and on the sacred air rang out the summons
to carnage again. But the affair at Holly Springs
had broken up the grand plan of attack, while the flying
troops from General Grant’s front reënforced the garrison.
Over the battlements of rebellion poured the iron
tempest upon Sherman’s unyielding lines. Securely the
foe remained behind those defences, rising for two miles
along the bluff, presenting a barrier no army small as the
“right wing” could scale or remove. Meanwhile the
sharpshooters from the forest dropped the officers on
every hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The brave Sherman was all the while expecting every
moment to hear the roar of General Grant’s guns in the
rear. With Monday came a succession of brilliant charges,
which were fruitless as the dash of sunlit waves against
the cannon-pierced granite of Gibraltar. If a momentary
advantage were gained, it was lost in the return tide
of overwhelming numbers. A spectator of these terribly
sublime encounters, wrote:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Morgan, at eleven o’clock <span class='sc'>a. m.</span>, sent word
to General Steele that he was about ready for the movement
upon the hill, and wished the latter to support him
with General Thayer’s brigade. General Steele accordingly
ordered General Thayer to move his brigade forward,
and be ready for the assault. The order was
promptly complied with, and General Blair received from
General Morgan the order to assault the hill. The artillery
had been silent for some time; but Hoffman’s battery opened
when the movement commenced. This was promptly
replied to by the enemy, and taken up by Griffith’s First
Iowa battery, and a vigorous shelling was the result. By
the time General Blair’s brigade emerged from its cover
of cypress forest, the shell were dropping fast among the
men. A field-battery had been in position in front of
Hoffman’s battery; but it limbered up and moved away
beyond the heavy batteries and the rifle-pits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In front of the timber where Blair’s brigade had
been lying was an abatis of young trees, cut off about
three feet above the ground, and with the tops fallen promiscuously
around. It took some minutes to pass this
abatis, and by the time it was accomplished the enemy’s
fire had not been without effect. Beyond this abatis was
a ditch fifteen or twenty feet deep, and with two or three
feet of water in the bottom. The bottom of the ditch was
a quicksand, in which the feet of the men commenced
sinking, the instant they touched it. By the time this
ditch was passed the line was thrown into considerable
confusion, and it took several minutes to put it in
order. All the horses of the officers were mired in
this ditch. Every one dismounted and moved up the hill on
foot. Beyond this ditch was an abatis of heavy timber
that had been felled several months before, and, from
being completely seasoned, was more difficult of passage
than that constructed of the greener and more flexible
trees encountered at first. These obstacles were overcome
under a tremendous fire from the enemy’s batteries
and the men in the rifle-pits. The line was recovered
from the disorder into which it had been thrown by the
passage of the abatis; and with General Blair at their
head, the regiments moved forward ‘upon the enemy’s
works.’ The first movement was over a sloping plateau,
raked by direct and enfilading fires from heavy artillery,
and swept by a perfect storm of bullets from the rifle-pits.
Nothing daunted by the dozens of men that had already
fallen, the brigade pressed on, and in a few moments had
driven the enemy from the first range of rifle-pits at the
base of the hill, and were in full possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Halting but a moment to take breath, the brigade
renewed the charge, and speedily occupied the second line
of rifle-pits, about two hundred yards distant from the
first. General Blair was the first man of his brigade to
enter. All this time the murderous fire from the enemy’s
guns continued. The batteries were still above this
line of rifle-pits. The regiments were not strong enough
to attempt their capture without a prompt and powerful
support. For them it had truly been a march</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';fs:.9em;' -->
<p class='line' style='font-size:.9em;'>Into the jaws of death—</p>
<p class='line' style='font-size:.9em;'>Into the mouth of hell.</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>“Almost simultaneously with the movement of General
Blair on the left, General Thayer received his command
to go forward. He had previously given orders to
all his regiments in column to follow each other whenever
the first moved forward. He accordingly placed
himself at the head of his advance regiment, the Fourth
Iowa, and his order—‘Forward, second brigade!’—rang
out clear above the tumult. Colonel Williamson,
commanding the Fourth Iowa, moved it off in splendid
style. General Thayer supposed that all the other regiments
of his brigade were following, in accordance with
his instructions previously issued. He wound through
the timber skirting the bayou, crossed at the same bridge
where General Blair had passed but a few minutes before,
made his way through the ditch and both lines of
abatis, deflected the right and ascended the sloping plateau
in the direction of the rifle-pits simultaneously with
General Blair, and about two hundred yards to his right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When General Thayer reached the rifle-pits, after
hard fighting and a heavy loss, he found, to his horror,
that only the Fourth Iowa had followed him, the wooded
nature of the place having prevented his ascertaining it
before. Sadly disheartened, with little hope of success,
he still pressed forward and fought his way to the second
line, at the same time that General Blair reached it on
the left. Colonel Williamson’s regiment was fast falling
before the concentrated fire of the rebels, and with an
anxious heart General Thayer looked around for aid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rebels were forming three full regiments of infantry
to move down upon General Thayer, and were
massing a proportionately formidable force against Gen.
Blair. The rebel infantry and artillery were constantly
in full play, and two heavy guns were raking the rifle-pits in
several places. With no hope of succor, General
Thayer gave the order for a return down the hill and
back to his original position. The Fourth Iowa, entering
the fight five hundred strong, had lost a hundred and
twenty men in less than thirty minutes. It fell back at a
quick march, but with its ranks unbroken and without
any thing of panic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It appears that just at the time General Thayer’s
brigade started up the hill, General Morgan sent for a
portion of it to support him on the right. General Steele
at once diverted the Second Regiment of Thayer’s brigade,
which was passing at the time. The Second Regiment
being thus diverted, the others followed, in accordance
with the orders they had previously received from their
commander. Notice of the movement was sent to General
Thayer; but, in consequence of the death of the courier,
the notification never reached him. This accounts
for his being left with nothing save the Fourth Iowa regiment.
The occurrence was a sad one. The troops thus
turned off were among the best that had yet been in action,
and had they been permitted to charge the enemy,
they would have won for themselves a brilliant record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When General Blair entered the second line of rifle-pits,
his brigade continued to pursue the enemy up the
hill. The Thirteenth Illinois infantry was in advance,
and fought with desperation to win its way to the top of
the crest. Fifty yards or more above the second line of
rifle-pits is a small clump of willows, hardly deserving
the name of trees. They stand in a corn-field, and from
the banks of the bayou below presented the appearance
of a green hillock. To this copse many of the rebels fled
when they were driven from the rifle-pits, and they were
promptly pursued by General Blair’s men. The Thirteenth
met and engaged the rebels hand to hand, and in
the encounter bayonets were repeatedly crossed. It gained
the place, driving out the enemy; but as soon as our
men occupied it, the fire of a field-battery was turned
upon them, and the place became too hot to be held.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The road from Mrs. Lake’s plantation to the top of
the high ground, and thence to Vicksburg, runs at an angle
along the side of the hill, so as to obtain a slope easy of
ascent. The lower side of this road was provided with a
breastwork, so that a light battery could be taken anywhere
along the road and fired over the embankment.
From the nearest point of this embankment a battery
opened on the Thirteenth Illinois, and was aided by a
heavy battery on the hill. Several men were killed by
the shell and grape that swept the copse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The other regiments of the brigade came to the support
of the Thirteenth, the Twenty-ninth Missouri, Colonel
Cavender, being in the advance. Meantime the rebels
formed a large force of infantry to bring against them,
and when the Twenty-ninth reached the copse the rebels
were already engaging the Union troops. The color-bearer
of the Twelfth had been shot down, and some one
picked up the standard and planted it in front of the copse.
The force of the rebels was too great for our men to stand
against them, and they slowly fell back, fighting step by
step toward the rifle-pits, and taking their colors with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this charge upon the hill the regiments lost severely.
In General Blair’s brigade there were eighteen
hundred and twenty-five men engaged in this assault, and
of this number six hundred and forty-two were killed,
wounded, and captured.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under a flag of truce the dead were buried and the
wounded removed, after which General Sherman gave the
order for his troops to reëmbark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The arrival of General McClernand at the scene of
action caused a change in the command, as he ranked
General Sherman by over one month in the date of his
commission; and an order was at once given by the former
to withdraw from the Yazoo River, where the vessels
were stationed, and return to the Mississippi River. General
McClernand, on assuming the command, ordered the
title of the army to be changed, and General Sherman
announced the fact in the following order:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Headquarters Right Wing Army of Tennessee</span>,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pursuant to the terms of General Orders No. 1,
made this day by General McClernand, the title of our
army ceases to exist, and constitutes in the future the
Army of the Mississippi, composed of two ‘army corps,’
one to be commanded by General G. W. Morgan and
the other by myself. In relinquishing the command of
the Army of the Tennessee, and restricting my authority
to my own corps, I desire to express to all commanders,
to soldiers and officers recently operating before Vicksburg,
my hearty thanks for their zeal, alacrity, and courage
manifested by them on all occasions. We failed in
accomplishing one purpose of our movement, the capture
of Vicksburg; but we were part of a whole. <span class='it'>Ours was
but part of a combined movement, in which others were to
assist. We were on time; unforeseen contingencies must
have delayed the others.</span> We have destroyed the Shreveport
road, we have attacked the defences of Vicksburg,
and pushed the attack as far as prudence would justify;
and having found it too strong for our single column, we
have drawn off in good order and good spirits, ready for
any new move. <span class='it'>A new commander is now here to lead
you.</span> He is chosen by the President of the United States,
who is charged by the Constitution to maintain and defend
it, and he has the undoubted right to select his own
agents. <span class='it'>I know that all good officers and soldiers will give
him the same hearty support and cheerful obedience they
have hitherto given me.</span> There are honors enough in reserve
for all, and work enough too. Let each do his appropriate
part, and our nation must in the end emerge
from this dire conflict purified and ennobled by the fires
which now test its strength and purity. All officers of the
general staff now attached to my person will hereafter report
in person and by letter to Major-General McClernand,
commanding the Army of the Mississippi, on board
the steamer <span class='it'>Tigress</span>, at our rendezvous at Gaines’ Landing
and at Montgomery Point.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/d.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='D'/>URING the weeks of early spring the deeply
laid plot against Vicksburg ripened into action.
Quietly the master mind of the plan to reach
and take it, had laid out the work for his commanders.
On different sides toward the enemy
feigned attacks were made to deceive the rebels. March
29th, the Thirteenth Corps, led by McClernand, made the
advance from Milliken’s Bend, the grand starting-point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gen. Sherman, with the Fifteenth Corps, was to bring
up the rear, and would therefore be last to leave in the
general advance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>April 28th a message in cipher, <span class='it'>i. e.</span> secret characters,
understood only by those in correspondence, was received
by him from General Grant, apprising him of the time
chosen for an attack on Grand Gulf. It also informed
him that an assault upon Haines’ Bluff, on the Yazoo
River, should “come off” at the same time, if it could
be done in a way to be understood by our loyal people.
For, to deceive the enemy and gain advantage over him,
while the pretended attack was thought to be [the] real one,
ending in defeat, would depress the national feeling, and
do more harm than good. This was the problem for
General Sherman to solve. He was sure he could make
the affair understood by his troops, and those for whom
they were fighting would not long be in the dark. He
therefore took ten steamers, and embarking with his true-hearted
warriors, started from Milliken’s Bend for the
Yazoo. The spectacle was beautiful—itself a <span class='it'>deception</span>
when contrasted with the havoc and horrors of conflict.
When the fleet steamed into the mouth of the river, other
vessels were waiting to join in the <span class='it'>ruse</span>. The whole
number of boats then moved, April 29th, to the Chickasaw
Bayou. The morning of the following day the fleet
pushed forward to the fort. Now came preparation for
action in the gunboats of Admiral Porter, the stir of the
gunners about their massive engines of destruction. A
few moments later the thunder of bombardment opened,
and for four hours it echoed over the works and waters.
The gunboats then retired out of range, and General
Sherman landed his force, while the rebels looked on,
expecting an immediate attack by him. No sooner had
the last soldier left the transports than the naval force advanced
and renewed the fire on the fortress. General
Sherman saw that the feint had succeeded, the foe was
getting ready to resist an assault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Says General Grant in his official report: “To prevent
heavy reënforcements going from Vicksburg to the
assistance of the Grand Gulf forces, I directed Sherman
to make a demonstration on Haines’ Bluff, and to make
all the show possible. From information since received
from prisoners captured, this ruse succeeded admirably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile, the magnificent naval scene in the passing
of Vicksburg by Admiral Porter’s fleet, and the unrivalled
and romantic raid of Colonel Grierson through the heart
of the enemy’s country to Baton Rouge, cutting railroads
southeasterly of the same defiant Gibraltar, gave their
promise of success to the bold plans of General Grant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While General Sherman was frightening the enemy,
and learning his strength and positions, General Grant
sent for the heroic commander. He at once forwarded to
Grand Gulf the two divisions of his corps left at Milliken’s
Bend; and soon as the night covered his feints on
the Yazoo, sailed down the tide to his encampment at
Young’s Point. Nor did he pause long here. With all
his troops, excepting a garrison to hold the position, he
hastened to Hard Times, four miles from Grand Gulf,
which you will see lies on the banks of the Mississippi in
Louisiana. It was a remarkable march of sixty-three
miles in about five days. The columns reached Hard
Times on the morning of the 6th, and the same evening
commenced crossing the ferry to join General Grant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now began in earnest the great movement of the
army toward Vicksburg; for here the supply-wagons
were furnished and in line of march, arrangements made
to send on more when needed, and the long cavalcade
put in motion. General Sherman commanded at Hard
Times upon General Grant’s advance, till the provision
for the many thousand troops was completed. Unless
you have seen this part of army-work, you have no idea
of the immense scale on which it is conducted. There
are miles of wagons, hundreds of horses and mules to
draw them, and an army of teamsters to drive the brute
muscle of the campaign. The gigantic locomotive storehouse
moved toward Hawkinson’s Ferry on the Black
River, where the commander-in-chief was waiting for it
and Sherman’s Corps. While this deliberate and determined
progress was made, the Mississippians were
getting alarmed. The Governor of Mississippi issued
a flaming proclamation, calling upon the people “to
awake and join their brothers in arms, who were
baring their bosoms to the storm of battle in defence of
all they held dear.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On May 12th, “Generals Sherman and McClernand
had skirmishing at Fourteen-Mile Creek, and McPherson
a successful engagement at Raymond. Sherman and
McPherson then started for Jackson, the capital of Mississippi,
the former on the turnpike road, the latter on
the Clinton road. The rain fell in torrents, making the
roads at first slippery and then miry. But the troops
marched without straggling, and in the best of spirits,
about fourteen miles, and engaged the enemy about twelve
o’clock <span class='sc'>m.</span>, near Jackson. The wily rebel General
Johnston, in command there, made a vigorous feint of
resisting Sherman’s progress by posting infantry and artillery
on the south side of the city, meanwhile moving
nearly all his force against McPherson. But Sherman
at once penetrated this device, by sending a reconnoitring
party to his right, which flanked the position. The
enemy retreated, after a heavy engagement with McPherson,
who had beaten him. From Jackson McPherson
and McClernand turned to Bolton; but Sherman was
left at Jackson, and effectually destroyed the railroads,
bridges, factories, workshops, arsenals, and every thing
valuable for the support of the enemy. General Grant
meanwhile, with the other two corps, had gained the decisive
victories of Champion’s Hill on the 16th of May,
and Big Black River on the 17th. Early on the former
day he sent for Sherman ‘to move with all possible
speed until he came up with the main force near Bolton.
The despatch reached him at ten minutes past seven <span class='sc'>a. m.</span>,
and his advance division was in motion in one hour
from that time.’ The other followed on its heels, and
both reached Bolton that night, by a forced march of
twenty miles. There orders came to keep on to Bridgeport;
and by noon of the next day the march to Bridgeport
was accomplished. There Sherman assumed the
advance, starting before dawn of May 18, and rapidly
marched toward Vicksburg. By a quick detour to the
right he managed to throw himself before night on Walnut
Hills, in a brilliant manœuvre, and thereby established
communication between the army and the fleet in the
Yazoo. On these latter movements of Sherman the comment
of General Grant is as follows:—‘His demonstration
at Haines’ Bluff, in April, to hold the enemy about
Vicksburg, while the army was securing a foothold east
of the Mississippi; his rapid marches to join the army
afterwards; his management at Jackson, Mississippi, in
the first attack; his almost unequalled march from Jackson
to Bridgeport, and passage of the Black River; his
securing Walnut Hills on the 18th of May, attest his
great merit as a soldier.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Grant first determined to carry Vicksburg
by assault, and ordered a general attack for two o’clock
of the 19th of May. General Sherman was, curiously
enough, on the ground he had before gallantly but vainly
striven to take, in December, having now seized it from
the rear without a struggle. Promptly at the hour his
men rushed to the work. The interval was a broad
reach, rugged and broken with deep ravines, and strewed
with abatis or felled timber, and with groves of standing
trees. It would have been a rough and impenetrable region
even if unswept with artillery. But in truth the
enemy’s cannon, carefully disposed, raked and enfiladed
almost every step. But the order was Forward! and forward
went the gallant brigade of General A. L. Lee, of
Osterhaus’s division, and, struggling across the impediments,
gained the crest of one of the ridges and planted
the colors of the Thirteenth infantry on the enemy’s first
line of works. The charge cost this regiment six officers
and seventy-seven men killed and wounded out of two
hundred and fifty. The column was then called off and
covered from fire. General Grant’s report says: ‘The
Fifteenth Army Corps, <span class='it'>from having arrived in front of
the enemy’s works in time</span> on the 18th to get a good position,
were enabled to make a vigorous assault. The
Thirteenth and Seventeenth Corps succeeded no further
than to gain advanced positions covered from the fire of
the enemy.’ On the morning of the 22d, a second and
more terrific assault was made by all three corps, preceded
by a tremendous cannonading from guns and mortars,
mingled with the heavy booming from the entire
fleet. The orders were to advance without firing a musket.
The army dashed forward across ravines and ditches, over
ground covered with artful tangles of cane and grapevines,
to find only new difficulties. Yet so far did some
of the gallant brigades advance as to lie underneath the
guns of the fort, while hand-grenades and lighter shells
were hurled over the parapet among them. The assault
is worthy to be mentioned with the names of Mamelon,
Vert, and Malakoff. But, like the Crimean stronghold,
this Sebastopol of the Mississippi could only be carried
by assault after a protracted siege. With fearful loss, the
gallant army was retired from the unequal fight, and regular
approaches commenced. The conduct, triumphant
issue, and joyful results of the siege, are familiar. On
the 4th of July, 1863, after a campaign of extraordinary
energy, the unconditional surrender of Vicksburg closed
up a series of movements of which General Halleck declares,
‘No more brilliant exploit can be found in military
history.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While, however, the rest of the army, on the national
holiday, moved into the city they had won, to
rejoice in their success, and to rest after exhausting
labors, for Sherman and his corps there was still work
in hand. About a fortnight before the surrender, General
Joe Johnston was threatening the rear of the besieging
army with a large improvised force. Grant at once
sent this message to Sherman: ‘You must whip Johnston
fifteen miles from here.’ But Johnston drew back upon
Jackson, and General Sherman was notified to be ready to
start against the latter place on July 6th. ‘I placed Major-General
Sherman in command of all the troops designated
to look after Johnston. Johnston, however, not
attacking, I determined to attack him the moment Vicksburg
was in our possession, and accordingly notified Sherman
that I would again make an assault on Vicksburg at
daylight of the 6th, and for him to have up supplies of
all descriptions ready to move upon receipt of orders if
the assault should prove a success. His preparations
were immediately made, and when the place surrendered
on the 4th, <span class='it'>two days earlier</span> than I had fixed for the attack,
<span class='it'>Sherman was found ready, and moved at once</span> with a force
increased by the remainder of both the Thirteenth and
Fifteenth Army Corps, and is at present (July 6th) investing
Jackson, where Johnston has made a stand.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Sherman was now intrusted with the chief
part of General Grant’s army: he moved so quickly that
the latter was able to telegraph to Washington, July 12th,
‘General Sherman has Jackson invested from Pearl River
on the north to the river on the south. This has cut off
many hundred cars from the Confederacy. General Sherman
says he has force enough, and feels no apprehension
about the result.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor was there occasion to fear; for the rebel chief
was under the eye of a lion in war’s arena, that never
missed his prey when fairly within his reach.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/g.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='G'/>ENERAL SHERMAN was in no haste to strike;
he could leisurely watch the foe chafing in the
narrow limits of his beleagured ground. Expeditions
were sent out in different directions,
the gallant troopers destroying railroad tracks,
bridges, and culverts, and bringing in supplies from the
enemy’s lands and granaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>July 11th they accidentally found in an old building,
carefully packed away, a large library, and various mementos
of friendship. A glance revealed the owner. A
gold-headed cane bore the inscription, “To Jefferson
Davis, from Franklin Pierce.” Precious plunder! The
arch traitor has hidden in the quiet country, and in a
place which could awaken no suspicion, his valuable library,
correspondence, and articles of cherished regard.
The excited troopers soon get into the book pile, and volumes,
heaps of letters, and handsome canes, are borne as
trophies (a new kind of forage) to headquarters. Secession
is discovered in many letters, by Northern friends
of the treasonable leader, and his right to that proud distinction
freely granted. Added to their capture, hundreds
of cars were taken from the Confederacy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 13th a heavy fog lay along the river-banks,
hiding from each other’s view the opposing armies. Suddenly
rebel shouts came through the gloom, and a desperate
sortie from their works is made upon General
Sherman’s defences. He is ready to meet the shock, and
after a brief struggle they stagger back to their intrenchments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The twilight hour of July 16th brought to a projection
of the works rebel bands of music, insulting our
troops with “Bonnie Blue Flag,” “My Maryland,”
“Dixie’s Land,” and other airs perverted to the service
of treason. The next morning’s dawn gave signs of a
retreating foe. The fighting Joe Johnston had stolen
away, leaving all over Jackson the marks of ruin. The
day before—July 15th—the President issued a proclamation
for national thanksgiving, on the 6th day of August,
for the recent victories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Johnston <span class='it'>was</span> fairly <span class='it'>whipped</span>, and without
the awful waste of life a great battle involves. And now
followed other bloodless, and yet exciting scenes of war.
You might have seen squads of cavalrymen galloping in
every direction, in the wake of the retreating foe, and,
with axe and torch, laying in ruins bridges and barns,
and whatever might serve the cause of rebellion. Of our
brave chieftain’s successes to this time, since he dashed
forward to Walnut Hills, after the first occupation of
Jackson, “the siege of Vicksburg and last capture of
Jackson, and dispersion of Johnston’s army, entitle General
Sherman to more honor than usually falls to the lot
of one man to earn.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The short period of rest enjoyed by the heroic army
was only one of preparation for a more difficult and
grander advance. The London <span class='it'>Spectator</span> said of the bold
and splendid campaign: It comprised “a series of movements
which were overlooked at the time, yet upon which
hung the safety of two Federal armies—the extraordinary
march of General Sherman from Vicksburg to Chattanooga.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The camp of the Fifteenth Army Corps, during this
interlude of marching, lay along the Big Black River,
between Jackson and Vicksburg, about twenty miles from
the latter. It was acting as guard to all that region
against any return movements or raids of the enemy. A
glance at the map will show you the exact position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there is a history of this and similar encampments
which will never be written. In the sultry air and poisonous
vapors of the Big Black, officers and men resorted to
every possible resource for whiling away the dull hours
and cheering the home-sick invalids.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not unfrequently, in the light of the evening-lamps,
the commander-in-chief has amused and interested by the
hour a circle of officers gathered about him, with the
narratives of his early adventures, presenting, with the
vividness of reality, the exciting life among the Indians of
Florida and the gold-seekers of California.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But one day there was an unusual stir around the
General’s headquarters; for visitors worth more to him
than all earthly honors or gold were escorted to his tent,
his wife and his son, bearing his own name, had come
from their western home, to meet him once more before
his long and perilous marches over hostile soil. But the
hours of domestic converse and delight flew swiftly by,
the farewells were spoken, and the well-guarded visitors
went on their homeward way. There was no safeguard
against disease lurking in those Southern swamps. The
gifted and beautiful boy, unconsciously to all, had been
smitten, and a raging fever soon laid him at the gate of
death. He had been adopted by the Thirteenth Corps as
their pet—a compliment both to him and his father, who
was himself the idol of those brave battalions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How this bereavement affected him and his old veterans,
you will know hereafter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>September 22d, General Grant telegraphed him from
Vicksburg to send forward immediately a division to reënforce
General Rosecrans, who had been defeated by
General Bragg at Chickamauga, and was obliged to retreat
to Chattanooga, unpursued by his successful enemy.
General Rosecrans commanded the Army of the Cumberland,
and was now holding the great central stronghold
in the vast battle-field between Vicksburg and
Charleston. At 4 o’clock of the same day the telegram
was read by General Sherman, who is always a minute
man. General Osterhaus’ division was on the road to
Vicksburg, and the following day “it was streaming toward
Memphis.” A day later, and the commander-in-chief
received orders to follow with the entire corps. The tents
disappeared like dew before the morning sun, and the
proud host were following the columns of Osterhaus toward
Memphis. Two divisions were transported by water.
But the low tide and scarcity of food made their progress
slow. The leader was impatient of delay, for he longed
to try the metal of his corps against that of General
Bragg. He is no fancy commander; but an incarnation
of nervous energy, with no display of tinsel in his attire,
helping with his own hands to bring in fence-rails to feed
the fires, then turning teamster to wagons hauling wood
from the interior to the boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the first days of October, while General
Osterhaus is in front of Corinth, his boats lie before
Memphis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And amid the absorbing duties of a grand campaign,
look into the General’s tent, and you shall see the warrior
for a moment lost in the grieving father, and will feel
that the scene is, indeed, “a touching episode of the war.”
The letter, addressed to the Thirteenth Infantry, and by
its officers ordered to be printed for distribution among
the soldiers of the regiment, cannot but touch a tender
chord in every heart. Stricken father, noble patriot, the
hero of uncounted battles; let the nation pause in its admiration
of his gallant deeds, to weep with the mourner
over the young life that no “bugle note” will awaken.</p>

you, and to the officers and soldiers of the battalion, for
their kind behavior to my poor child. I realize that you
all feel for my family the attachment of kindred; and I
assure you all of full reciprocity. Consistent with a
sense of duty to my profession and office, I could not
leave my post, and sent for my family to come to me in
that fatal climate, and in that sickly period of the year,
and behold the result! The child that bore my name,
and in whose future I reposed with more confidence than
I did in my own plans of life, now floats a mere corpse,
seeking a grave in a distant land, with a weeping mother,
brother, and sisters clustered about him. But, for myself
I can ask no sympathy. On, on, I must go to meet a

till its flag is adored and respected by ourselves and
all the powers of the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But my poor Willy was, or thought he was, a sergeant
of the Thirteenth. I have seen his eye brighten
and his heart beat as he beheld the battalion under arms,

was, he had the enthusiasm, the pure love of truth, honor,
and love of country, which should animate all soldiers.
God only knows why he should die thus young. He is
dead, but will not be forgotten till those who knew him
in life have followed him to that same mysterious end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please convey to the battalion my heartfelt thanks,
and assure each and all that if, in after years, they call

of sympathy with words. The chieftain went to his
war-path, while the sculptor’s chisel was busy on the
marble, until it formed a lasting memorial of manly affection
cherished by the troops for father and son. Wrote
one who saw it in Cincinnati before it was removed to
the “silent city:”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At Rule’s marble works we observed recently a
beautiful monument to the memory of Major-General
Sherman’s son, who died over a year since, in Memphis,
while returning home with his mother from the Black
River, where they had been visiting the General, and
where, unfortunately, the boy contracted a fever. The
monument was made by order of the Thirteenth Regiment
of Regular United States Infantry, of which General
Sherman was Colonel four years since, and of which his
namesake-son, the deceased child, was, by general consent,
considered a sergeant, having been elected to that
position by the members of the regiment, who were very
proud of him. The monument is about two feet square
at the base, and six feet high. Above the rough ground
base is the marble base, an eight-sided, finely-polished
and ornamented block. Upon four of the faces are inscriptions,
and upon the other four, between them, the
American shield, with its Stripes and Stars. Surmounting
the base is a full-sized tenor drum, with straps and
sticks complete, and crossed above this two flags of the
Union—all in beautiful white marble. The inscriptions
are as follows:</p>

which are three hundred and nine miles
apart. The Memphis and Charleston Railway connect
them. The Tennessee and Elk Rivers cross the country,
many of whose bridges were gone, and the foe lurked
along the lines of travel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when General Sherman received orders from
General Halleck to transport his troops to Athens, Alabama,
repairing the railroad and getting his supplies as
best he could, he was off with the haste of a prepared and
fearless leader, whose heart was in the cause, for whose
triumph he fought. But instead of using boats, “his
quick eye saw that he could move his trains faster by
road under escort.” He therefore did so, and conveyed
into the enemy’s country the entire Fourth Division over
the iron track.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alarmed by this very dangerous move eastward,
the enemy quickly assembled at Salem and Tuscumbia,
with intent to thwart it and to foil the junction with Rosecrans.
At the former point Chalmers collected three
thousand cavalry and eight pieces of artillery, and planted
himself in our path. Hearing of this, General Sherman,
on October 11th, put his whole force in motion
toward Corinth, and himself started thither in a special
train with a battalion of the Thirteenth Infantry (his
own regiment) as escort. On approaching Colliersville,
which was defended by a few troops in a stockade, the
train was fired upon, and it was discovered that Chalmers
was investing the place. Instantly the General ordered
his regulars to charge, and under his eye they scattered
the rebels in all directions, and reached the stockade.
Before General Sherman’s arrival, the little garrison had
been sorely pressed in a severe contest. The General
soon changed the aspect of affairs, and beat off the superior
force. Corinth being reached next night, he sent
General Blair to Iuka with the First Division, and pushed
troops toward Bear Creek, five miles east of Iuka, as
fast as they came up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Foreseeing difficulties in crossing the Tennessee, he
had written to Admiral Porter at Cairo to watch the
river and send up gunboats as soon as the water would
permit, and to General Allen at St. Louis to despatch a
ferry-boat to Eastport. The requests were promptly fulfilled.
It now only remained to work away at the railroad,
in accordance with orders, covering his working-parties
from the enemy’s attacks. At the same time he
despatched Blair with two divisions to drive the enemy
from Tuscumbia, where, under Stephen Lee, they were
five thousand strong. It was accomplished after a severe
fight at Cane Creek; and Tuscumbia was occupied on
the 27th of October.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pause here, to get a glimpse of the general movements
in the programme of war, of which this was no inferior
part. General Grant had been put in command of
the “Departments of the Ohio, of the Cumberland, and
of the Tennessee, constituting the military division of the
Mississippi.” In the latter General Sherman was appointed
to the command, while General Thomas succeeded
General Rosecrans in the department of the Cumberland.
October 23d, General Grant, modestly wearing
his new laurels, reached Chattanooga. The enemy occupying
Lookout Mountain, with their terraces of cannon
cut off our troops to get their scanty supplies by the
most difficult mountain routes. Wrote a Union soldier
of the sad condition of things there:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I confess I do not see any very brilliant prospects
for continuing alive in it all this winter, unless something
desperate be done. While the army sits here, hungry,
chilly, watching the ‘key to Tennessee,’ the ‘good dog’
Bragg lies over against us, licking his Chickamauga sores
without whine or growl. He will not reply to our occasional
shots from Star Fort, Fort Crittenden, or the Moccasin
Point batteries across the river; has forbidden the
exchange of newspapers and the compliments of the day
between pickets; has returned surly answers to flag-of-truce
messengers; in fact, has cut us dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The mortality among the horses and mules is frightful
to contemplate. Their corpses line the road, and
taint the air, all along the Bridgeport route. In these
days, hereabouts, it is within the scope of the most obtuse
to distinguish a quartermaster or a staff officer by a
casual glance at the animal he strides. ‘He has the fatness
of twenty horses upon his ribs,’ as Squeers remarked
of little Wackford; and so he has. God help the
others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am assured that this state of things will not last
long; that hordes of men are energetically at work improving
our communication, and that we soon shall be
benefited by the overflowing plenty of the North. The
vigor and good spirits of the army all this time are developed
in a most astonishing manner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Relief was nearer than the writer deemed at the
time. General Sherman, at Iuka, reorganized his new
command on the very day of the battle at Cane Creek,
and sent General Ewing with a division to cross the Tennessee,
and hasten with all possible speed to Eastport.
A messenger from General Grant on the same day came
down the river over the Muscle Shoals, with an order to
suspend his work on the railroad, and press forward to
Bridgeport. No message ever found a more welcome ear.
November 1st, the chieftain led his columns across the
Tennessee and on to the branch of the Elk River. But
the river was unfordable, and with no leisure to construct
a bridge or ferry, he was compelled to take a circuitous
route along the stream by the way of Fayetteville, where
he mapped out the routes for the different divisions, and
hastening to Bridgeport, sent to General Grant, by telegram,
the position of his army. November 15th, the
unresting commander of admiring and uncomplaining
troops reined up his steed at the headquarters of General
Grant in Chattanooga, after more than three hundred
miles of varied and difficult travel between him and Memphis,
where he lay during the early days of October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hero of Vicksburg welcomed with delight his peer
in the field of war’s most daring exploits. Though worn
and weary with their unrivalled, if not hitherto unequalled
march, such was his confidence in his brave men, he
heard without hesitation the order to bring them across
the Tennessee, secure a position at the extremity of Missionary
Ridge, and also threatened Lookout Mountain;
saying for himself, “I saw enough of the condition of
men and animals in Chattanooga to inspire me with renewed
energy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Away he flies to execute the commands. He does not
wait for means of conveyance; he has no false ideas of
dignity to interfere with the business in hand. Taking a
row-boat, he glides before the strokes of his own strong
arms, down the river to Bridgeport. The divisions are
soon in order of march. But oh! what roads! <span class='it'>Mud—mud—mud!</span>
is before the unflinching columns. They toil
on, their leader sharing with them the exhausting labor,
till three divisions, on the 23d, are sheltered from the observation
of the enemy behind the hills, opposite the mouth
of the Chickamauga.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Night comes on, and with silent, stealthy steps, a force
advanced along the Tennessee, taking prisoners nineteen
out of twenty men who were on picket duty. By daylight
eight thousand troops were on the banks of the river,
ready to cross over and fasten upon Missionary Ridge.
Before the sun was above the hill-tops, a pontoon bridge,
three hundred and fifty feet long, was commenced, and at
1 <span class='sc'>p. m.</span> <span class='it'>it was done</span>. Proudly the grand cavalcade
streamed over the causeway of boats, and advanced toward
the desired position. These movements were favored
by the concealment—a providential interposition—which
“a light, drizzling rain and low-hanging clouds” afforded.
Three o’clock found them safely lodged at the terminus
of Missionary Ridge. Up the hill the gallant
ranks pressed, completely surprising the enemy, who, in
his vexation at the humiliating success of the flanking
generalship, opened a fruitless fire of artillery and musketry.
The “boys” could not allow this, and, dragging
their own guns up the acclivity, soon silenced the noisy
demonstration of impotent wrath. But beyond and higher
was a spur, still more important in the coming trial of
strength between the two great armies. Fortifying the
ground gained, at midnight the orders passed along the
columns to advance at dawn.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/m.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='M'/>Y reader cannot even imagine, in his peaceful
home, the dread interest which broods over
preparation for a great and decisive battle.
Thoughts of the loved and absent throng the
minds of brave men; hasty letters are written,
and messages left, should they fall in mortal combat.
Bibles are read, prayers offered, and hope rekindled in
many heroic hearts. Ambulances and “stretchers” are
made ready for the wounded, and surgeons arrange their
instruments, lint, and bandages, while orders are passed
from the commanding general down to the lieutenant.
This work of preparation went forward at Chattanooga
during the hours of November 23d.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Writes Colonel Bowman, the friend of General Sherman,
a scholar, a gentleman, and a gallant soldier: “In
the plan of the battle, Hooker was to hold the enemy at
Lookout Mountain, and carry it, if possible. General
Sherman was to vigorously assault Missionary Ridge. As
that was their vital point, the enemy would mass to defend
it. This would weaken the centre, upon which Thomas
would rush, to penetrate it. Simple and plausible as this
plan seemed, and successful as it proved, to most men
who looked up at the frowning and precipitous heights
which towered even into the clouds, above Chattanooga,
with rebel works studded with artillery commanding
every rugged approach, the idea of carrying them seemed
little short of madness. The rebels felt so secure as to
risk sending Longstreet’s entire corps to Knoxville, where
it closely besieged the army of Burnside. ‘By half-past
three <span class='sc'>p. m.</span> of the 24th,’ says Grant, ‘the whole of the
northern extremity of Missionary Ridge, to near the tunnel,
was in Sherman’s possession. During the night he
fortified the position thus secured, making it equal, if not
superior, in strength to that held by the enemy.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before dawn of the 25th of November General
Sherman was in the saddle, and had made the entire
tour of his position in the dim light. It was seen that a
deep valley lay between him and the precipitous sides of
the next hill in the series, which was only partially cleared,
and of which the crest was narrow and wooded. The
farther point of the hill was held by the enemy, with a
strong breastwork of logs and fresh earth, crowded with
men, and carrying two guns. On a still higher hill beyond
the tunnel he appeared in great force, and had a fair
plunging fire on the intermediate hill in dispute. The
gorge between these two latter hills, through which the
railroad-tunnel passes, could not be seen from Sherman’s
position, but formed the natural <span class='it'>place d’armes</span>, where the
enemy covered his masses ‘to resist our turning his right
flank, and thus endangering his communications with the
Chickamauga depot.’ General Corse was to have the
advance; ‘and the sun had hardly risen,’ says Sherman,
‘before his bugle sounded the “Forward.” ’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His men moved briskly down into the valley and up
the steep sides of the hill in front, and, in spite of all
opposition, carried and held a sort of secondary crest on
the enemy’s hill, which, however, was swept with a murderous
fire from the breastworks in front. And now for
more than an hour a very bloody and desperate conflict
raged, our line now swaying up close to the breastwork,
as though it would sweep over and engulf it, and anon
dashed back, receding far away to its first conquest.
Meanwhile, Sherman’s left, on the outer spur of the ridge,
and his right abreast of the tunnel, were hotly engaged,
and partially drew the enemy’s fire from the assaulting
party on the hill-crest. Our artillery also plumped shot
and shell into the breastwork, and strove to clear the hill
in Corse’s front. About ten <span class='sc'>a. m.</span> the fight raged furiously,
and General Corse was severely wounded. Two
brigades of reënforcements were sent up; but the crest
was so crowded that they had to fall away to the west of
the hill. At once the heavy masses of the enemy in a
gorge, under cover of the thick undergrowth, moved out
on their right and rear. So suddenly overwhelmed, the
two supporting brigades fell back in some confusion to
the lower edge of the field, where they reformed in good
order; but, as they constituted no part of the real attack,
the temporary rebuff was unimportant. General Corse,
Colonel Loomis, and General M. L. Smith still stubbornly
held the attacking column proper up at the crest. General
Grant says of them, ‘The assaulting column advanced
to the very rifle-pits of the enemy, and held their
position firmly and without wavering.’ ‘When the two
reserved brigades fell back,’ says Sherman, ‘the enemy
made a show of pursuit, but was caught in flank by the
well-directed fire of one brigade on the wooded crest, and
hastily sought his cover behind the hill.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The desperate and incessant attack of General
Sherman was triumphantly successful. It was directed
against, in the words of Grant, ‘the enemy’s most northern
and vital point,’ and ‘was vigorously kept up all day.’
Sherman’s position not only threatened the right flank of
the enemy, but also his rear and stores at Chickamauga.
The enemy, therefore, began very early to mass his line
down against the single gallant storming party. ‘At
three <span class='sc'>p. m.</span>,’ writes Sherman, ‘column after column of
the enemy was streaming toward me, gun after gun
poured its concentric shot on us from every hill and spur
that gave a view of any part of the ground.’ Long and
anxiously he waited for the centre to open its part of the
contest, and meanwhile held stubbornly to his bloody
ridge under murderous fire. Grant, keeping his eye fixed
on this key point, sent a division to Sherman’s support,
but he sent it back with the note that ‘he had all the force
necessary.’ Now at last the time had come for seizing
victory out of doubtful battle. Hooker on the right had
gallantly swept round the enemy’s left. ‘Discovering
that the enemy,’ says General Grant, ‘in his desperation
to defeat or resist the progress of Sherman, was weakening
his centre on Missionary Ridge, determined me to
order the advance at once.’ It was ordered and gallantly
executed. The huge masses with which Sherman was
contending, now, to their dismay, found Thomas on their
left flank, and the centre of their long line broken in. They
turned; but it was too late. The white line of Thomas’s
musketry swept up from ridge to ridge, and the army of
Bragg was flung back, in overwhelming defeat, into the
valleys of Georgia. Thus was the great victory of
Chattanooga won.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now pursuit swiftly followed victory. The
same night Sherman pushed his skirmishers out, and,
finding that enemy had given way, sent a division after
him to the depot, and followed it up at four <span class='sc'>a. m.</span> with
a part of Major-General’s Howard’s Eleventh Corps.
As the column advanced, wagons, guns, caissons, forage,
stores, pontoons, and all the ruins of a defeated army
and an abandoned camp, were found on the route. At
night of the 26th, so rapid was the pursuit that the
rear-guard of the enemy was reached, and a sharp
fight ensued, till darkness closed in. The next day all
three armies pressed on, Hooker and Thomas sharing
with Sherman the marching and fighting. General
Sherman meanwhile detached Howard to move against
the railroad between Dalton and Cleveland, and destroy
it. This was done, and communication thereby cut between
Bragg and Longstreet. The same movement also
turned the flank of the enemy, who were engaging
Hooker so heavily further south at Ringgold that the latter
sent to Sherman to turn their position. It was already
done before Hooker’s messenger arrived. Continuing to
Ringgold, he found General Grant. The enemy had been
driven from Tennessee, and Sherman was ordered to
move leisurely back to Chattanooga. The next day he
effectually destroyed the railroad from half-way between
Graysville and Ringgold to the State line, and General
Grant ‘consented that, instead of returning to Chattanooga,
he might send back all my artillery, wagons, and
impediments, and make a circuit by the north as far as
the Hiawassee.’ This, too, was effected, with the destruction
of more railroad and the capture of more stores.
‘This,’ says Sherman, ‘was to have been the limit of our
journey. Officers and men had brought no baggage or
provisions; and the weather was bitter cold.’ But at
this time Grant received an urgent appeal for relief from
Burnside, stating that his supplies could only last until
the 3d of December. Nothing but incomparable energy
would save Knoxville and its gallant commander.
Granger had already been ordered thither, but ‘had not
yet got off,’ says General Grant, ‘nor would he have the
number of men I directed. Besides, he moved with reluctance
and complaint. I therefore determined, notwithstanding
the fact that two divisions of Sherman’s
forces had marched from Memphis and had gone into battle
immediately on their arrival at Chattanooga, to send
him with his command.’ Accordingly General Sherman
received command of all the troops designed for relieving
Knoxville, including Granger’s. ‘Seven days before,’ he
writes, ‘we had left our camps on the other side of the
Tennessee, with two days’ rations, without a change of
clothing, stripped for the fight, with but a single blanket
or coat per man, from myself to the private included.
Of course, we then had no provisions, save what we
gathered by the road, and were ill supplied for such a
march. But we learned that twelve thousand of our
fellow-soldiers were beleaguered in the mountain town of
Knoxville, eighty-four miles distant, that they needed
relief, and must have it in three days. This was enough;
and it had to be done.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That night General Howard repaired and planked
the railroad-bridge, and at daylight the army passed the
Hiawassee and marched to Athens, fifteen miles. On the
2d of December the army hurried thence toward London,
twenty-six miles distant, and the cavalry pushed ahead to
save the pontoon bridge across the Tennessee, held by
Vaughn’s brigade of the enemy. They moved with such
rapidity as to capture every picket, but found Vaughn
posted strongly in earthworks containing artillery in position.
They were forced to wait till night, when Howard’s
infantry came up. During the night the enemy retreated,
destroying the pontoons, running three locomotives and
forty-eight cars into the Tennessee, and leaving for Howard
to capture at daylight a large quantity of provisions,
four guns, and other material.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The bridge was gone, and but one day of the allotted
three remained. The same night, therefore, Sherman
sent word to Colonel Long, commanding the cavalry brigade,
that Burnside must know within twenty-four hours
of his approach—ordering him to select his best material,
to start at once, ford the Little Tennessee, and push into
Knoxville, ‘at whatever cost of life and horse-flesh.’ The
distance to be travelled was forty miles, and ‘the road
villanous.’ Before dawn they were off. At daylight the
Fifteenth Corps was turned from Philadelphia to Morgantown;
but even at this place the Little Tennessee was
found too deep for fording. A bridge was skilfully extemporized
by General Wilson—‘working partly with
crib-work and partly with square trestles made of the
houses of the late town of Morgantown;’ and by dark
of December 4th the bridge was down and the troops
passing. Next morning came the welcome message from
Burnside, dated December 4th, that Long’s cavalry had
reached Knoxville on the night of the 3d, and all was
well. Just before this news, the diagonal bracings of
Wilson’s bridge had broken, from want of proper spikes,
and there was delay. But the bridge was mended, and
the forced march continued, till, at Marysville, on the
night of the 5th, a staff officer of General Burnside rode
up to announce that Longstreet had raised the siege the
night before. Sending forward Granger’s two divisions
to Knoxville, General Sherman at once ordered the rest of
his gallant army to halt and rest; for their work was done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Sherman rode from Marysville to Knoxville,
greeted General Burnside, and freely expressed his
admiration at the skilful fortification of the place, including
Fort ‘Saunders,’ where Longstreet’s assaulting columns
had met a bloody repulse. Knoxville being saved,
it was obviously best for Sherman’s army, excepting
Granger’s two divisions, to return to support the suspended
movement against Bragg. But before General
Sherman left he received the following letter:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Knoxville</span>, <span class='it'>December 7th, 1863</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;'><span class='sc'>To Major-General Sherman</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I desire to express to you and your command my most hearty
thanks and gratitude for your promptness in coming to our relief during
the siege of Knoxville, and am satisfied your approach served to
raise the siege.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>A. E. BURNSIDE, Major-General.</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Sherman now leisurely returned to Chattanooga,
his cavalry giving chase for some distance to a
rebel wagon-train on the way. On the 14th of December
his command reached the banks of the Hiawassee. Four
days of easy marches brought them to Chattanooga, after
a three-months’ campaign unparalleled in the history of
the war. His losses had amounted to something over
two thousand men. His official report states that his
men had marched for long periods, without regular rations
or supplies of any kind, through mud and over rocks,
sometimes barefooted, without a murmur. Without a
moment’s rest, after a march of over four hundred miles,
without sleep for three successive nights, they crossed the
Tennessee River, fought their part in the battle of Chattanooga,
pursued the enemy out of Tennessee, then turned
more than a hundred miles north and compelled Longstreet
to raise the siege of Knoxville, which had been the
source of anxiety to the whole country. ‘The praises of
Confederate generals,’ says the London <span class='it'>Spectator</span>, in reviewing
some of these facts, ‘have been sung abundantly
on this side the water: the facts are, that all military skill
and military perseverance and courage are not on one
side.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Such a display of genuine military qualities
should not pass without some record; and we offer it to
our readers as some proof that, with all their faults, the
Federal officers and soldiers are not without great virtues,
which soldiers at least should admire.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Sherman repaired to Vicksburg to look after
the affairs of the widening field of the Union army under
his leadership. Here, in answer to inquiries from Adjutant-General
Sawyer, at Huntsville, Alabama, he wrote a
splendid letter, both in comprehensiveness of views and
the clear vigorous style of composition. If you begin it
you will want to finish it, though long. It is full of fire,
historical knowledge, and yet so plain a child can understand
it. The matter discussed, is the treatment of rebels
in a conquered territory:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Headquarters Department of the Tennessee</span>, }</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Vicksburg</span>, <span class='it'>Jan. 31, 1864</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;'>“Major <span class='sc'>R. M. Sawyer</span>, <span class='it'>Assistant Adjutant-General,</span></p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='it'>Army of the Tennessee, Huntsville</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sawyer</span>: In my former letter I have answered
all your questions save one, and that relates to
the treatment of inhabitants known or suspected to be
hostile or ‘secesh.’ This is in truth the most difficult
business of our army as it advances and occupies the
Southern country. It is almost impossible to lay down
rules, and I invariably leave the whole subject to the
local commanders, but am willing to give them the benefit
of my acquired knowledge and experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Europe, whence we derive our principles of war,
as developed by their histories, wars are between kings
or rulers, through hired armies, and not between peoples.
These remain, as it were, neutral, and sell their produce
to whatever army is in possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Napoleon, when at war with Prussia, Austria, and
Russia, bought forage and provisions of the inhabitants,
and consequently had an interest to protect farms and
factories which ministered to his wants. In like manner,
the allied armies in France could buy of the French
inhabitants whatever they needed, the produce of the soil
or manufactures of the country. Therefore, the rule was
and is, that wars are confined to the armies, and should
not visit the homes of families or private interests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But in other examples a different rule obtained the
sanction of historical authority. I will only instance
that, when in the reign of William and Mary the English
army occupied Ireland, then in a state of revolt, the inhabitants
were actually driven into foreign lands, and
were dispossessed of their property, and a new population
introduced. To this day a large part of the north
of Ireland is held by the descendants of the Scotch emigrants
sent there by William’s order and an act of Parliament.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The war which now prevails in our land is essentially
a war of races. The Southern people entered
into a clear compact of government, but still maintained
a species of separate interests, history, and prejudices.
These latter became stronger and stronger, till they have
led to a war which has developed fruits of the bitterest
kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We of the North are, beyond all question, right in
our lawful cause, but we are not bound to ignore the fact
that the people of the South have prejudices, which form
a part of their nature, and which they cannot throw off
without an effort of reason or the slower process of
natural change. Now, the question arises, should we
treat as absolute enemies all in the South who differ
from us in opinion or prejudice, kill or banish them; or,
should we give them time to think, and gradually change
their conduct so as to conform to the new order of things,
which is slowly and gradually creeping into their country?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When men take arms to resist our rightful authority,
we are compelled to use force, because then all reason
and argument fail. When the provisions, horses, mules,
wagons, etc., are used by the enemy, it is clearly our
duty and right to take them, because otherwise they
might be used against us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In like manner, all houses left vacant by an inimical
people are clearly our right, or such as are needed as
storehouses, hospitals, and quarters. But a question
arises as to dwellings used by women, children, and non-combatants.
So long as the non-combatants remain in
their homes and keep to their accustomed business, their
opinions and prejudices in nowise influence the war, and
therefore should not be noticed. But if any one comes
out into the public streets and creates disorder, he or she
should be punished, restrained, or banished either to the
rear or front, as the officer in command adjudges. If the
people, or any of them, keep up a correspondence with
parties in hostility, they are spies, and can be punished
with death, or minor punishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are well-established principles of war, and
the people of the South having appealed to war, are
barred from appealing to our Constitution, which they
have practically and publicly defied. They have appealed
to war, and must abide its rules and laws. The United
States, as a belligerent party claiming right in the soil
as the ultimate sovereign, have a right to change the
population, and it may be and is both politic and just we
should do so in certain districts. When the inhabitants
persist too long in hostility, it may be both politic and
right we should banish them and appropriate their lands
to a more loyal and useful population. No man will
deny that the United States would be benefited by dispossessing
a single, prejudiced, hard-headed and disloyal
planter, and substitute in his place a dozen or more
patient, industrious, good families, even if they be of
foreign birth. I think it does good to present this view
of the case to many Southern gentlemen, who grow rich
and wealthy, not by virtue alone of their industry and
skill, but by reason of the protection and impetus to
prosperity given by our hitherto moderate and magnanimous
Government. It is all idle nonsense for these
Southern planters to say that they made the South, that
they own it, and that they can do as they please—even to
break up our Government, and to shut up the natural
avenues of trade, intercourse, and commerce.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We know, and they know, if they are intelligent beings,
that, as compared with the whole world, they are
but as five millions are to one thousand millions; that
they did not create the land; that their only title to its
use and usufruct is the deed of the United States, and
that if they appeal to war, they hold their ally by a very
insecure tenure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For my part, I believe that this war is the result of
false political doctrines, for which we are all as a people
responsible, viz.: That any and every people have a
right to self-government; and I would give all a chance
to reflect, and when in error to recant. I know slaveowners,
finding themselves in possession of a species of property
in opposition to the growing sentiment of the whole
civilized world, conceived their property in danger, and
foolishly appealed to war; and by skilful political handling
involved with themselves the whole South on the
doctrines of error and prejudice. I believe that some of
the rich and slaveholding are prejudiced to such an extent
that nothing but death and ruin will extinguish, but
hope that as the poorer and industrial classes of the South
will realize their relative weakness, and their dependence
upon the fruits of the earth and good will of their fellow
men, they will not only discover the error of their ways,
and repent of their hasty action, but bless those who persistently
maintained a constitutional Government, strong
enough to sustain itself, protect its citizens, and promise
peaceful homes to millions yet unborn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this behalf, while I assert for our Government
the highest military prerogatives, I am willing to bear in
patience that political nonsense of slave rights, State
rights, freedom of conscience, freedom of press, and
such other trash, as have deluded the Southern people
into war, anarchy, bloodshed, and the foulest crimes
that have disgraced any time or any people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would advise the commanding officers at Huntsville,
and such other towns as are occupied by our
troops, to assemble the inhabitants and explain to them
these plain, self-evident propositions, and tell them it
is for them now to say whether they and their children
shall inherit the beautiful land which by the accident
of nature has fallen to their share. The Government of
the United States has in North Alabama any and all
rights which they choose to enforce in war, to take their
lives, their homes, their lands, their every thing, because
they cannot deny that the war does exist there, and war
is simply power unrestrained by constitution or compact.
If they want eternal war, well and good—we will accept
the issue and dispossess them, and put our friends in possession.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know thousands and millions of good people who,
at simple notice, would come to North Alabama and accept
the elegant houses and plantations now there. If the
people of Huntsville think different, let them persist in
war three years longer, and then they will not be consulted.
Three years ago, by a little reflection and patience
they could have had a hundred years of peace and
prosperity, but they preferred war; very well, last year
they could have saved their slaves, but now it is too late;
all the powers on earth cannot restore to them their slaves
any more than their dead grandfathers. Next year their
lands will be taken, for in war we can take them, and
rightfully, too, and in another year they may beg in vain
for their lives. A people who will persevere in war beyond
a certain limit, ought to know the consequences.
Many, many people, with less pertinacity than the South,
have been wiped out of national existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My own belief is, that even now the non-slaveholding
classes of the South are alienating from their associations
in war. Already I hear criminations. Those who
have property left, should take warning in time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since I have come down here I have seen many
Southern planters who now hire their negroes, and acknowledge
that they knew not the earthquake they were
to make by appealing to Secession. They thought that
the politicians had prepared the way, and that they could
depart in peace. They now see that we are bound together
as one nation in indissoluble ties, and that any
interest or any people that set themselves up in antagonism
to the nation must perish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While I would not remit one jot or tittle of our
nation’s right in peace or war, I do make allowances for
past political errors and false prejudices. Our national
Congress and Supreme Courts are the proper arenas in
which to discuss conflicting opinions, and not the battle-field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may not hear from me again, and if you think
it will do any good call some of the better people together
and explain these my views. You may even read
to them this letter and let them use it, so as to prepare
them for my coming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To those who submit to the rightful law and authority,
all gentleness and forbearance, but to the petulant and
persistent secessionists, why, death is mercy, and the
quicker he or she is disposed of the better. Satan, and
the rebellious saints of heaven, were allowed a continuance
of existence in hell, merely to swell their just punishment.
To such as would rebel against a Government
so mild and just as ours was in peace, a punishment equal
would not be unjust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are progressing well in this quarter. Though
I have not changed my opinion that we may soon assume
the existence of our National Government, yet years will
pass before ruffianism, murder, and robbery will cease to
afflict this region of our country.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;'>“Truly, your friend,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='sc'>W. T. Sherman</span>,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>Major-Gen. Commanding.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it was at the beginning of the war, so in this
earnest declaration of views, the great commander keeps
in advance of the popular and ruling ideas of the conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like Napoleon in military genius and sublimely daring
marches, he is vastly his superior in principles of
human progress, and the foundations of true national
prosperity.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/t.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='T'/>HE holidays of the season which introduced the
year 1863 had scarcely passed, and your gifts
of affection, young reader, were still in your
hands, or in a snug corner of your home, when
the untiring chief, who was and is defending
that home from the hosts of rebellion, was planning a
grand expedition into Central Mississippi.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The map will show you the town of Meridian, where
important railroads have their junction, more than a hundred
miles from Vicksburg. To this centre of the empire,
claimed by the usurper Davis, around which lay the
richest corn and cotton fields of the South, and swarmed
the toiling slaves, General Sherman determined to lead
his battalions. You must recollect, he would have to cut
loose from his “base of supplies,” and, with a long
wagon-train carrying rations for twenty days, conduct his
“movable column”—that is, the entire army in motion,
and with no communications open—over the enemy’s
country, where well-disciplined troops were not very far
from his path. It was a most daring adventure, but just
like the brave commander who conceived it. Comprehending
the gigantic revolt, and the vital points in the
Confederacy, he has had but one view of the means to
suppress the infamous rebellion. Had his plan been
adopted, the war might have been ended now. Large
armies, bold and rapid movements into the home of secession,
sparing nothing that affords it any nourishment, has
been the war-creed of General Sherman. February found
the campaign complete in preparation. On the 3d the
commander left the streets of Vicksburg, reining his
steed toward Meridian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days before, General W. S. Smith was to leave
Memphis, Tenn., with eight thousand cavalry, and join
him at Meridian. The course of march was in part along
the track in which the troops advanced on Vicksburg.
The cavalcade of twenty thousand men, followed by miles
of supply-wagons, crossed the Big Black River, moved
along by Champion Hills and Clinton to Jackson. Here
General McPherson, with the Sixteenth Corps, and General
Hurlbut, with the Seventeenth Corps, who had taken
different routes, met General Sherman, and were united
to his army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rebels did not seem to care about fighting the
daring chieftain, but retreated before him. At Line
Creek resistance was offered, a short battle followed,
and again the host moved forward, taking the towns of
Quitman and Enterprise, on every hand spreading
alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>February 13th he reached the Big Chunkey River.
Meridian was the next point to be gained, when, with all
his forces, he could push on, getting between General
Johnston and Mobile, where Commodore Farragut was
thundering with his naval ordnance, and perhaps interfere
very much with General Polk’s army. Meanwhile, military
depots would disappear before the torch, and other
havoc with supplies distract and cripple the foe. With
such successes, it would not be difficult to hasten over the
intervening ground, and hurl his legions against the city
from the land side, thus finishing the work Commodore
Farragut had so well commenced. At Meridian, February
13th, 150 miles from Vicksburg, he congratulated his
troops in these words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The General Commanding conveys his congratulations
and thanks to the officers and men composing this
command, for their most successful accomplishment of
one of the great problems of the war. Meridian, the
great railway centre of the Southwest, is now in our possession,
and, by industry and hard work, can be rendered
useless to the enemy, and deprive him of the chief source
of supply to his armies. Secrecy in plan and rapidity of
execution accomplish the best results of war; and the
General Commanding assures all that, by following their
leaders fearlessly and with confidence, they will in time
reap the reward so dear to us all—a peace that will never
again be disturbed in our country by a discontented minority.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But as General Grant’s delay at Holly Springs, on
account of its cowardly surrender, turned the first attack
upon Vicksburg into a defeat, so by the failure of General
Smith to start from Memphis till the 13th of February,
the further success of the expedition was made impossible.
Still, the affair was a magnificent raid into the heart of
“rebeldom,” which spread terror along its way, and left
the ruins of railroads, bridges, and storehouses behind,
while securing animals and various material for the use
of the Union army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great commander was now compelled to turn his
column toward Vicksburg again, which he entered three
weeks after his departure, having led his troops safely
across hostile soil more than two hundred and fifty miles,
surrounded by large armies. March 2d, General Sherman
reached New Orleans in the gunboat <span class='it'>Diana</span>, and
when referring to his expedition, termed it “a big raid
only.” Before he had rested his heroic men, a law which
had been before Congress while he was marching, was
passed, creating the office of Lieutenant-General, the
President conferring the honor of it upon Major-General
Grant. The same order of March 12th gave to General
Sherman the command before held by the hero of Vicksburg,
called the Department of the Mississippi, and including
the smaller departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland,
and the Tennessee, with the Arkansas. Around
him were to stand Generals McPherson, Hooker, Thomas,
Hurlbut, Logan, Schofield, and Howard, the “Havelock
of the army.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grandest and most decisive campaigns of the
war were now planned. The Army of the Potomac,
commanded by General Meade, was again to start for
Richmond, under the eyes of the Lieutenant-General;
and the divisions of General Sherman were to take Atlanta,
the former the “head, the latter the heart of the
Confederacy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a sublime crisis in the struggle. The two
great heroes of the conflict had in their hands enterprises
worthy of their genius, and which would hold the interest
of the nation and of the world. For if either of
the bold movements succeeded, the other it would seem
must, because beyond the single victory were the vast
results of the cöoperating armies on the coast, from the
mouth of the James River to Savannah. Immediately
upon receiving the notice of his appointment, in the middle
of March, General Sherman began a tour of inspection,
visiting Athens, Decatur, Huntsville, Chattanooga, Knoxville,
and other places of military importance, carefully
acquainting himself with the extent and resources of the
new field of his command. From reports published, it
is believed that on the 1st day of May the effective
strength of the several armies, for offensive purposes,
was about as follows:</p>

<p class='noindent'>About these figures were maintained during the campaign,
the number of men joining from furlough and
hospitals about compensating for the loss in battle and
from sickness. These armies were grouped on the morning
of May 6th, as follows: That of the Cumberland at
and near Ringgold; that of the Tennessee at Gordon’s
Mill, on the Chickamauga; and that of the Ohio near
Red Clay, on the Georgia line, north of Dalton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A reference to the map again will show you Dalton
on the railroad between Chattanooga and Atlanta, with
Ringgold northwest of it. A distinguished general of the
army describes the advance:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Marching from Chattanooga on the 5th of May,
and from Ringgold on the 7th, he first encountered Johnston
at Tunnel Hill, a strong position, but which was
used by him merely as an outpost to his still stronger one
of ‘Buzzard Roost.’ This latter is a narrow gorge or
pass in the Chatoogata Mountains, flanked on one side
by the precipitous sides of Rocky Face Ridge (not unlike
the Palisades of the Hudson River) and on the other by
the greater but less precipitous elevation called John’s
Mountain. This gorge was commanded on the Dalton
side by an amphitheatre of hills, which, as well as the
tops of Rocky Face and John’s Mountain, was crowned
by batteries, lined with infantry, and terraced by sharpshooters.
The railroad and wagon-road wind through
the gorge, which is absolutely the only passage through
the mountains at this place. Taking a leaf from the
book of his Yorktown experience, Johnston had skilfully
flooded the entrance to the gorge by damming a neighboring
mountain-stream, and covering both railroad and
wagon-road with water to the depth in some places of
eight to ten feet. It is scarcely possible to conceive a
stronger defensive position, and the rebels had been induced
to believe that it was unassailable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pass, which doubtless received its name from a
large bird common at the south, was made impassable
by abatis, and piles driven down filling the defile, and
the whole overflowed by the waters of Mill Creek.
Two days’ reconnoissance and sharp skirmishing proved
to General Sherman that an attack in front would cost
too great a sacrifice of life, and that the pass must be
turned. The means for this were found in a gap called
Snake Creek Gap, some fifteen miles to the southwest.
The thick dark forest, by its concealment, would protect
the march. Rising almost perpendicularly are the
flinty sides of Rocky Face, on the other side of which
stands Oak Knob. Into this wild and romantic seclusion
our army pushed its front, while the rebels lurked in the
heights around and above the Union “boys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Morgan, whose command was there, relates,
that “a corporal of Company I, Sixtieth Illinois, broke
from the line, and under the cover of projecting ledges
got up within twenty feet of a squad of rebels on the summit.
Taking shelter from the sharpshooters, he called
out:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I say, rebs, don’t you want to hear Old Abe’s amnesty
proclamation read?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes! yes!’ was the unanimous cry, ‘give us the
ape’s proclamation.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Attention!’ commanded the corporal, and in a
clear and resonant voice he read the amnesty proclamation
to the rebels, beneath the cannon planted by rebel
hands to destroy the fabric of Government established by
our fathers. When he arrived at those passages of the
proclamation where the negro was referred to, he was interrupted
by cries of ‘None of your Abolitionism; look
out for rocks!’ And down over his hiding-place descended
a shower of stones and rocks. Having finished
the reading, the corporal asked:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Well, rebs, how do you like the terms? Will you
hear it again?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Not to-day, you bloody Yank. Now crawl down
in a hurry and we won’t fire,’ was the response; and the
daring corporal descended and rejoined his command,
which had distinctly heard all that passed. I regret I
could not learn the name of the corporal, for he must get
promotion at the hands of Father Abraham and Governor
Dick Yates.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another incident of army life at this crisis of the
campaign will interest you: While on Rocky Face General
Howard stood upon a ledge of rocks from which
he could see a large force of rebels upon a projecting spur
of the ridge immediately beneath him. Tired of gazing
upon the enemy, the General, in the absence of hand
grenades, lighted the fuse of shells, and amused himself
by dropping them down into the centre of the enemy,
in whose ranks there was quite a lively commotion in
consequence. The frightened enemy little suspected that
the hand that dropped the shells into their ranks was the
companion of the one lost at Fair Oaks by the fearless
leader of the Eleventh Army Corps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flank movement was led by General McPherson
with the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Corps, and Garrard’s
division of cavalry, supported by General Thomas with
the Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps, while Generals
Howard and Schofield, with the Fourth, Twenty-third,
and Stoneman’s division of cavalry, “amused the enemy
in front.” Suddenly General Johnston waked up from
his dream of security, and hastily abandoning his stronghold
fell back upon a new position to save his communications,
which were around the town of Resaca,
almost due south from Chattanooga, and distant from it
by railroad fifty-six miles. It is situated in Gordon
County, Georgia, on the north bank of the Coosawattee
River, which flows southwest, changing its name to the
Oostalantee, and joins Etowah at Rome, the two forming
the Coosa, which, joining the Tallapoosa, forms the Alabama,
and flows into the Gulf at Mobile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The railroad bridge at Resaca, destroyed by the rebels
on their retreat, is one of the most important, perhaps
the most important, on the Western and Atlantic Railway;
it is six hundred feet long. The distance from
Resaca to Atlanta is eighty-two miles by rail, and the
country much more favorable for our operations than
that from Chattanooga to Resaca.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rebel general began to learn lessons of caution in
the <span class='it'>flanking</span> school of General Sherman, and so guarded
the extremities of his army that the latter was compelled
to try a direct assault in front. For three days the
sound of battle at intervals echoed among the hills, with
constantly increasing advantage to the vigilant, skilful,
and unyielding Sherman, until he had in his possession
commanding hills, with railroads and bridges in his rear.
Eight guns, two flags, large quantities of stores, and several
hundred prisoners, were the trophies of the hard-earned
victories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night of the 15th of May the rebel chief, finding
himself outwitted and outflanked, made a hurried retreat.
When the morning revealed the flight of the foe, General
Sherman’s army started in pursuit. General Thomas,
second only in splendid achievements and gallantry to his
commander, was “directly on his heels,” while Generals
McPherson and Schofield took different routes. Amusing
scenes occasionally lit up the darkest hours of night and
conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the whole operations of Saturday and Sunday,
while forcing General Johnston from his intrenchments,
General Beatty’s brigade, of Wood’s division, was in
reserve. The boys did not relish their position, and, while
the battle raged with great fury, they showed unmistakable
signs of uneasiness. One fellow, more daring than
his companions, quietly sauntered out and made for the
front. Meeting a wounded soldier returning from the
front, the “Buckeye” borrowed his “fixins” and entered
Hazen’s brigade, where he fought bravely until shot in the
jaw. Retiring to the rear, he met a staff-officer, who
inquired the number of his regiment, and, learning it
was not under fire, asked how he came to be wounded.
“Well,” replied the soldier, “you see I don’t like to
be back in the rear, so I came out to take a shot at
the Johnnies, and I be dogged if they haven’t peppered
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At nine on Saturday night the Nineteenth Alabama
was lying in line, with a rebel battery separating it from
another regiment. The battery was withdrawn, and the
colonel of the Nineteenth went down to fill the gap with
his regiment; he was accompanied by four hundred men.
Arriving at the gap they found it filled with pickets, who
quietly “took them in out of the wet,” and brought them
in. Our boys had crawled up unobserved, and filled the
gap in the enemy’s line, captured Colonel McSpadden and
companions, and retired without receiving a shot. The
rebel colonel himself highly praised the strategy of his
captors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Onward through forest, across streams, and over
heights, the nobly proud and confidant columns pressed
toward Atlanta. The song and joke—the sacred page
and prayer—the inexcusable oath—all marked the long
marches, the night encampment, and the morning hour
of preparation to renew the tramp of embattled legions
toward the interior of the Confederate Territory. How
sublime the music, rising over that moving host, which
a listener thus describes:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At early dawn one morning, ere the troops were fully
awakened from their slumbers, the melodious notes of
‘Old Hundred,’ given forth by one of the brigade bands,
rang out upon the air, and were echoed by the green-capped
hills beyond. Soldiers intently occupied in preparing
the morning meal stood still and listened to the
melody, and instinctively joined in it. It flew from
regiment to regiment; brigade after brigade took it
up, and, ere the notes of the band ceased to reverberate,
five thousand voices were raised in ‘Praise God
from whom all blessings flow.’ A moment later all was
still. Breakfast was taken; and so silently did the veterans
of many battle-fields break camp and fall into line
that everybody remarked it, and complimented them for
their conduct. I have heard ‘Old Hundred’ often, when
the lungs of the organ seemed inspired with life, and
a congregation joined their melodious voices, but never
until to-day did I hear it sung with the full inspiration of
the soul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>May 25th, General Thomas’s troops, with the fearless
Hooker in the advance, were sweeping toward Dallas,
when the enemy crossed their path. The action of New
Hope Church came off, leaving the Union colors streaming
victoriously over the exulting volunteers. But there
was a different flag taken from hostile hands. General
Stoneman, the splendid cavalry officer, captured from the
Third Texas Cavalry a black flag with a skeleton figured
upon it together with a death’s head and cross-bones.
This flag is no myth or creation of the wild fancy of some
terrified trooper, but a reliable thing now in possession of
a surgeon in the General’s command, and seen and handled
by the members of General Schofield’s staff. They
are said to have carried it from the first. What they expect
to have understood by it is easily arrived at from
the remark of a member of another Texas regiment who
was taken prisoner and brought to headquarters. When
asked by a member of the staff if he belonged to the regiment
which carried the black flag, he replied that he did
not, else he should not have been brought there. It is,
perhaps, needless to state that our men are reported to
have taken no prisoners from the Third Texas Cavalry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the forces were approaching Dallas, occurred
one of war’s striking contrasts, related by a participant
in the scenes:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Last night the enemy kept up a lively demonstration
along our whole line sufficient to interfere slightly with
our slumbers at headquarters. About three o’clock yesterday
afternoon Cheney’s First Illinois Battery, 20-pounder
Parrott guns, opened a brisk fire upon a strong
rebel fortification, one mile from Dallas, which frowns
upon our lines at an altitude of nearly two hundred feet,
and from which a fine view is easily obtained of our
movements. The cannonade was continued till sunset,
shells bursting in all directions, scattering their death-dealing
fragments among loyal and disloyal. The monotony
was relieved by the constant arrival of mounted
orderlies bearing their important despatches of the
enemy’s doings from the respective brigade and division
commanders, while the music of the Minié balls, as they
whistled through the trees over our heads, lent enough
exhilarating excitement to the afternoon hours to dispel
all thought of drowsiness. While the musketry rattled
quite lively along our lines, causing the vales to reverberate,
and the loud reports of the deadly rifles rang through
the mountain forests, the military bands were discoursing
sentimental and patriotic melodies within sound of the
rebel lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So near have our skirmishers advanced to the
enemy’s front, that last night, while a prayer-meeting was
being held in the rebel camps, our troops could hear quite
distinctly their appeals to Heaven for peace. I regret to
state that some of the ‘Yankees’ were sacrilegious
enough to interpolate the names of Grant and Sherman,
just at the point where the traitors invoked health and
strength to Lee and Johnston. The tone of their petitions
was for peace, which Gen. Sherman is determined they
shall not enjoy until he secures that piece of Georgia
which he has marked out as the reward for his invincible
army.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this crisis in the march, already among the rivers
flowing to the Gulf, with the iron-works on their banks
at different points, General Sherman issued an order containing
directions respecting care of the wounded, who
were to be carried from the field by the musicians and
others not in the ranks; and requiring hospitals to be kept
nearer the moving columns, protecting them by the irregularities
on the surface, and not by distance. Here is
what he says of cowards:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Skulking, shirking, and straggling behind in time
of danger, are such high detestable crimes that the General
Commanding would hardly presume them possible,
were it not for his own observation, and the report that
at this moment soldiers are found loafing in the cabins, to
the rear, as far back as Kingston. The only proper fate
of such miscreants is that they be shot, as common enemies
to their profession and country; and all officers and
patrols sent back to arrest them, will shoot them without
mercy, on the slightest impudence or resistance. By thus
wandering in the rear they desert their fellows, who expose
themselves in battle in the full faith that all on the rolls
are present, and they expose themselves to capture and
exchange as good soldiers, to which they have no title.
It is hereby made the duty of every officer who finds
such skulkers, to deliver them to any provost guard, regardless
of corps, to be employed in menial or hard
work, such as repairing roads, digging drains, sinks, &amp;c.
Officers, if found skulking, will be subjected to the same
penalty as enlisted men, viz., instant death, or the hardest
labor and treatment. Absentees not accounted for, should
always be mustered as deserters, to deprive them of their
pay and bounties, reserved for honest soldiers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cannot chronicle all the battles and skirmishes of
the “running fight”—not <span class='it'>from</span> the enemy, but after him.
The charge upon Allatoona Pass by the Union cavalry,
June 2d, where General Sherman had flanked General
Johnston a week before, was a brilliant display of valor
baptized in blood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first week in June had passed, and General Sherman’s
troops, after marching more than a hundred miles
since leaving Chattanooga, through a country unknown
to them, daily skirmishing with the watchful foe, striking
against works capable of resisting twice their number of
troops, and all the time without broken ranks, gaining substantial
advantage, now fairly confronted General Johnston
intrenched upon Lost Mountain, Pine Hill, and Kenesaw
Mountain, three bold peaks connected together by a line
of ridges, and twenty-six miles north of Atlanta. His line
was closely circumscribed by ours. In no place were the
hostile parallels more than a musket-shot apart. The
rebel right rested on Kenesaw Mountain, on the railroad,
four miles north of Marietta, their left on Lost Mountain,
some six miles west of Kenesaw. Between these two
formidable ridges the rebels had gradually been forced
back from a triangle, with the apex toward us, until their
line was but a faint crescent, their centre still being
slightly advanced. Right, left, and centre, their position
was closely invested. Our troops shed parallel after
parallel, until the country in their rear was furrowed
with rifle-pits and abatis, and scored with a labyrinth of
roads.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The country is covered with primitive forests, and in
very few places are there cleared spaces sufficiently large
to display the movements of a brigade. There is an
abundance of scrubby undergrowth which hides every
thing a few yards distant from view; and when one inspects
the difficulties, it seems hardly credible, though
such is the case, that we fully developed the enemy’s
position with two days’ skirmish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A brave officer from whose accurate observations
passages have already been taken, says of this halting-place
in the great race for Atlanta: “The ridge in front
of Kenesaw commences about Wallace’s House on the
Burnt Hickory and Marietta road, and extends thence
across the railroad behind Noonday Creek about two miles
in an east-by-north direction. Lost Mountain and Kenesaw
are about eleven hundred feet high, Pine Hill and
Brushy Hill about four hundred feet high, and the ridges
everywhere about one hundred and fifty to two hundred
feet, or about the same as, and, in fact, not very dissimilar
to Missionary Ridge at Chattanooga. The enemy was
everywhere strongly intrenched behind log barricades,
protected by earth thrown against them, with a ditch,
formidable abatis, and in many places a chevaux-de-frise
of sharpened fence-rails besides. Their intrenchments
were well protected by thick traverses, and at frequent
intervals arranged with emplacements and embrasures for
field-guns. The thickness of this parapet was generally
six to eight feet <span class='it'>at top</span> on the infantry line, and from
twelve to fifteen feet thick at the top, where field-guns
were posted or where fire from our artillery was anticipated.
The amount of digging and intrenching that
Johnston’s army had done is almost incredible. General
Sherman’s tactics resulted in wresting Lost Mountain,
Pine Hill, the ridge in front of Kenesaw, and Brushy
Hill from the enemy, and forcing back his two wings,
Kenesaw Mountain operating as a sort of hinge, until his
left was behind Olley’s Creek, and his right behind the
stream which flows between the houses named on the
map as McAffee and Wiley Roberts. Kenesaw Mountain
then became the projecting fortress of the defensive line,
the wings being turned backward from it. It is a rocky
eminence, rather precipitous, thickly-wooded, and crowned
with batteries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our respective lines were about eight or nine miles
in length, from six hundred to seven hundred yards distant
from each other, and strongly intrenched. Skirmishing
went on incessantly, and artillery duels occurred two
or three times daily. The enemy at different times made
some dozen or more assaults, sometimes getting within
fifty yards of our intrenchments, but were always repulsed,
and generally with heavy loss to them. To gain
certain positions, we opened a heavy artillery fire upon
their whole line, pressed their two flanks heavily, and
made assaults in two places upon their centre. The assaults
were unsuccessful; but the Twenty-third Corps,
upon their extreme right, gained important advantages
of position.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wrote another: “We fancy out here that the over-expectant
loyal public are disappointed at the seemingly
slow progress of our cause in this department. It is only
necessary to state that the immense amount of supplies
required for an army of this size, to be transported a distance
of over two hundred miles through the enemy’s
country, with a single-track railroad, is a gigantic undertaking.
As for subsisting upon the country, that is out
of the question, the inhabitants themselves depending upon
the charity of the ‘ruthless invaders’ for daily sustenance.
Forage, ordnance stores, and commissary supplies, must
all flow through this single artery with lightning rapidity,
if we would replenish these stores as fast as exhausted.
Nothing but the most thorough organization and complete
system, with great energy in the various departments,
could ever have prevented our troops from suffering for
the want of food and clothing. The public can never appreciate
the innumerable natural obstacles that have embarrassed
the operations of this unflinching army. The
truly loyal do not demand any such explanations as these,
for with such leaders as Grant and Sherman apprehension
is groundless; but of late the Copperhead press, not content
with misrepresenting and belittling General Grant’s
victorious advance toward the rebel capital, sneer at General
Sherman’s generalship, and insinuate already, in the
face of brilliant successes achieved, that the ‘On to Atlanta’
movement is a failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Standing upon the martial-crowned top of Pine
Mountain, amid the fluttering of those peculiar flags used
by the Signal Corps, we learned that from this eminence
were transmitted, in those mysterious signals, all the
movements of the enemy, and such operations of our
army as were necessary. In front of you stands the defiant,
frowning Kenesaw, with its thick woods concealing
the rebel batteries from view that line its steep sides,
while five or six miles west of Kenesaw, Lost Mountain
lifts its sugar-loaf crest to the sky, solitary and alone,
looming up against the gorgeously tinted clouds that deck
the heavens. Just before you, looking south, can be discerned
the suburbs of Marietta, with the Georgia Military
Institute standing out prominently in the picture. Gazing
down the steep declivity into the thickly-wooded vales
which lie at the spectator’s feet, a magnificent panorama
of natural beauty is unfurled. So close are the lines of
the contending armies, that the dense volumes of smoke
from their camp fires roll up united, but hang in portentous
clouds over friend and foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While wrapt in silent admiration, mixed with a deep
sense of awe at the wild and romantic scene before me,
the bands encamped in the valley which encircles the base
of the mountain struck up the ‘John Brown’ or ‘Glory
Hallelujah Chorus,’ the echoes of which vibrated, re-echoed,
and, finally, as the sun’s departing rays began to
fade from the horizon, its pathetic notes died away, or
mingled with the rattle of musketry which flashed along
our skirmish line. I can never forget the peculiar impression
photographed upon my mind by the swelling of
this historical anthem of Freedom’s first battle, as it
grandly sailed over Pine Mountain. My reverie was soon
disturbed by the sudden roar of many batteries belching
out their savage peals with fearful rapidity from both
sides, and for several minutes quite an artillery duel was
indulged in, interspersed with short rolls of musketry. It
was curious to watch the rebel guns, as the smoke lazily
curled from the cannon’s mouth, while the solid shot
whizzed and shells shrieked over our breastworks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the incidents of this part of the great campaign
was a dress parade of the rebels on the top of
Kenesaw Mountain. Our lines were so near, that the
display was distinctly visible and audible. Below the
regiment, whose bayonets gleamed in the rays of the setting
sun, were the bristling rifle-pits. A courier suddenly
dashed up to the adjutant, and handed him a despatch
from General Johnston, announcing that General
Sherman “had brought his army so far south, that his
line of supplies was longer than he could hold; that he
was too far from his base—just where their commanding
general wished to get him; that a part of their army
would hold the railroad, thirty miles north of the Etowah;
and that the great railroad bridge at Allatoona had been
completely destroyed; that in a few days Sherman would
be out of supplies, because he could bring no more trains
through by the railroad. They were urged to maintain a
bold front, and in a few days the Yankees would be
forced to retreat. Breathless silence evinces the attention
which every word of the order receives, as the adjutant
reads. Cheers are about to be given, when hark!
loud whistles from Sherman’s cars, at Big Shanty, interrupt
them. The number of whistles increase. Allatoona,
Ackworth, and Big Shanty depots resound with them.
Supplies have arrived. The effect can easily be imagined.
The illustration was so apt, the commentary so appropriate,
that it was appreciated at the instant. ‘Bully for
the base of supplies!’ ‘Bully for the long line!’ ‘Three
cheers for the big bridge!’ ‘Here’s your Yankee cars!’
‘There’s Sherman’s rations!’ Bedlam was loose along
their line for a short time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a tree in front of General Herron’s division
of the Fifteenth Army Corps, to which was given the
name of <span class='it'>fatal tree</span>. Seven soldiers in succession, who
hid behind it to shoot, were killed. Then a board was
put on the tree, on which was chalked “dangerous.”
The rebels soon shot this sign to pieces, when a sergeant
took his position there, and in less than two minutes two
Minié balls pierced his body, making the eighth victim
of rebel bullets—a tragical <span class='it'>item</span> in war’s dread work.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/j.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='J'/>UNE 14th, General Hooker was on the right and
front of the rebel intrenchments, General Howard
on the left and front. A heavy cannonading was
opened, filling the air with bursting shells and
whistling balls, till the old mountains echoed with
the thunder and shouts of battle, and hung upon their
tops the streamers of its sulphurous smoke. Look away
among the rebel battalions, and mark that daring and
conspicuous officer, with the air of dignified, cultivated,
and mature manhood. With words of command on his
lips, he reels, and falls from his steed. The fatal missile
has opened the life current of the Bishop and General
Polk, the severest loss to the rebels of that sanguinary day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next morning brightened the summit of Pine
Mountain without the gleaming bayonets and bristling
cannon on which the sunset rays fell a few hours before;
the enemy had abandoned the summit during the night.
The heroic Thomas and Schofield immediately advanced,
and found the stubborn foe again strongly intrenched
along a range of rocky hills running from Kenesaw to
Lost Mountain. General McPherson crowded the opposing
lines on the left. The unyielding and steady advance
of the Union forces made the sides of Lost Mountain
too warm for the rebels, and on the 17th, just when
General Sherman was about to order a charge, they
withdrew, leaving in our hands not only the formidable
heights, but the “admirable breastworks connecting it
with Kenesaw Mountain.” Onward through dark forests
and across deep ravines, the resolute chief led the “boys,”
fighting every step of the way, toward the next fiery
barrier of bullets and steel. This was found at Kenesaw.
The fastness had become the last defence against the
Northern troops among the peaks which had for more
than two weeks frowned upon them. It was the enemy’s
front, the outer lines having fallen back to cover Marietta
and the railroad to the Chattahoochie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sadly glorious deeds were done in these wilderness
fights. When the One Hundred and Nineteenth New
York regiment was so near the hostile ranks that a halt to
throw up a temporary breastwork of logs was necessary,
by some singular and melancholy mistake a party of
twelve or fifteen men were ordered to advance beyond
these works on picket duty. Though knowing that it
was almost certain death to show their heads above the
walls of their little fort, still they obeyed without question
or hesitation. They had advanced scarcely more than
a rod beyond their comrades, when a heavy volley of
musketry prostrated to the ground every man save two!
Two were killed instantly, and the rest wounded more or
less severely. All of the wounded, however, were able to
drag themselves back and escape, except one poor fellow,
Sergeant Guider, who was so badly wounded that he
could not stir from his place. There he lay almost within
arms-length of his comrades, and yet they were powerless
to rescue him or give him aid, so galling was the
rebel fire. One bolder than the rest made the hazardous
attempt, but scarcely had he got over the breastworks
when he fell severely wounded. They endeavored to
allay his raging thirst by throwing to him canteens of
water, and even one of these was pierced by a rebel
bullet. Finally, as they could not go over the breastworks,
they dug a way under them with no other implements
than their bayonets, and through it two men crawled
and succeeded in reaching him unhurt. Just as they
reached him their comrades in the rear gave an exultant
cheer, which elicited from the rebels another volley. A
fatal ball pierced the poor fellow’s breast for a second time,
and he had only time to murmur feebly to his rescuers,
“Now I die content; I am in your hands,” and expired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the terrible assault upon the stronghold to
dislodge the enemy. Oh, how bravely yet vainly did the
columns to whom the voice of their leader was enough
to take them anywhere, dash against the rocks terraced
with cannon! Again the charge sounded, and, like tides
thundering on the face of Gibraltar, the lion-hearted
Hooker hurled his forces upon the death-dealing intrenchments.
There was an Illinois regiment, whose sublime
patriotism, like that of the One Hundred and Nineteenth
New York, shed immortal radiance on the sanguinary
field, assuring all men that our conflict is no tragical
play of ambition, or murderous work of revenge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the bloody charge led by General Hooker, the
Twenty-seventh Illinois was pressing upon the rebel works;
and when they had approached very near them, Michael
Delaney, the color-bearer, rushed some ten paces forward
ahead of his regiment, and holding aloft the starry banner
of his country, shouted to his comrades to follow.
Just then a ball struck his left arm, inflicting a flesh
wound, from which the blood trickled in profuse currents.
Still grasping the flag, and keeping it to the breeze, he
drew his revolver, and rushing forward, leaped upon the
enemy’s works, waving his flag, and firing his pistol upon
the foe. Thus, standing upon the enemy’s works, his
pistol in hand, and his colors streaming over his head,
two rebels approached him, one on each side, and thrust
their bayonets into the sides of the hero martyr. He felt
the cold steel pierce to the very quick of his young life,
yet he did not falter. With the blood gushing from his
wounds, he clasped the flag to his breast, and bore it back
in safety to his comrades, among whom he soon after
bled to death. Though no star or eagle decorated his
shoulders, he is of the country’s heroes, his name stamped
among theirs, high on the roll of honor. Though no
sculptured marble may mark the spot of his lonely grave
among the melancholy pines of northern Georgia, his intrepid
bravery entitles him to the homage of all who
honor the flag he so bravely bore, and laid down his life
to save. The Twenty-seventh Illinois regiment suffered
heavily, but behaved nobly, in this fierce and unequal
contest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the unresting, yet patient, sagacious commander,
in his own report, tells us how he alarmed
his antagonist, and drew him away from the slopes
of Kenesaw to save his path of retreat: “On the 1st
of July General McPherson was ordered to throw his
whole army by the right down to and threaten Nickajack
Creek and Turner’s Ferry, across Chattahoochie. General
McPherson commenced his movement on the night
of July 2d, and the effect was instantaneous. The next
morning Kenesaw was abandoned, and with the first
dawn of day I saw our skirmishers appear on the mountain
top. General Thomas’s whole line was then moved
forward to the railroad, and turned south in pursuit toward
the Chattahoochie. In person I entered Marietta
at 8.30 o’clock in the morning, just as the enemy’s cavalry
vacated the place. General Logan’s corps of General
McPherson’s army, which had not moved far, was ordered
back into Marietta by the main road, and General
McPherson and General Schofield were instructed to cross
Nickajack, and attack the enemy in flank and rear, and,
if possible, to catch him in the confusion of crossing the
Chattahoochie; but Johnston had foreseen and provided
against all this, and had covered his movement well. He
had intrenched a strong <span class='it'>tête-du-pont</span> at the Chattahoochie,
with an advanced intrenched line across the road at
Smyrna camp-meeting ground, five miles from Marietta.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Strange scenes, indeed, are witnessed in this civil war:
“The two armies in Georgia met in the persons of some
of their superior officers—Generals Clayborne, Cheatham,
Hindman, and Maney—parties having been detailed from
each by mutual agreement, for the burial of their dead.
Grouped together in seemingly fraternal unity were officers
and men of both contending armies, who but five
minutes before were engaged in the work of slaughter
and death. Cheatham looked rugged and healthy, though
seemingly sad and despondent. He wore his ‘fatigue’
dress, a blue flannel shirt, black necktie, gray homespun
pantaloons, and slouch black hat. Colonel Clancy, of the
Fifty-second Ohio, in talking to Generals Maney and
Hindman, remarked that it was a sad state of affairs to
witness human beings of a common origin and nationality
dig two hours every day to bury the dead of twenty
minutes’ fighting. ‘Yes, yes, indeed,’ said one, ‘but if
the settlement of this thing were left to our armies there
would be peace and good fellowship established in two
hours.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the “forward to Atlanta!” ringing over the
proud ranks of Generals Logan, Howard, Palmer, and
Hooker, moving out through the enemy’s works, and defiling
into the valley along the railroad toward Marietta,
let us look into the deserted mountain fortress. First you
will notice twenty feet in front of the battlements, to prevent
approach, the small trees cut down and sharpened,
presenting an impenetrable thicket of pointed green-wood
under the “dread artillery.” Besides, “hay-rakes,” as
they are called by the “boys,” are added. They are trees
half of a foot in diameter, pierced with two rows of auger
holes about the same distance apart, through which are
driven sticks sharp at both ends—no trifling barrier to a
successful charge. Inside of the defences all the means
of strength suggested by military art had been employed
to make them impregnable. But before the irresistible
Sherman, General Johnston is obliged to retreat, hastening
on toward the bulwarks of Atlanta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Smyrna, General Sherman continues: “General
Thomas found him, his front covered by a good parapet,
and his flanks behind the Nickajack and Rottenwood
Creeks. Ordering a garrison for Marietta, and General
Logan to join his own army near the mouth of Nickajack,
I overtook General Thomas at Smyrna. On the 4th of
July we pushed a strong skirmish line down the main
road, capturing the entire line of the enemy’s pits, and
made strong demonstrations along Nickajack Creek, and
about Turner’s Ferry. This had the desired effect, and
the next morning the enemy was gone, and the army
moved to the Chattahoochie, General Thomas’s left flank
resting on it near Price’s Ferry, General McPherson’s
right at the mouth of Nickajack, and General Schofield in
reserve; the enemy lay behind a line of unusual strength,
covering the railroad and pontoon bridges and beyond the
Chattahoochie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The commander-in-chief now began to cast about for
places to ford the Chattahoochie, whose waters crossed
his path. He had secured three safe points of passage
above his enemy, with good roads running toward the
city, ten miles distant, on which his eager eye was
fixed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Marietta, where General Johnston paused to make a
faint resistance before reaching the river, is a pleasant
town which before the war contained a thousand inhabitants,
with neat villas and elegant brick mansions.
Nearly all the families left before or with the rebel
army on their retreat, leaving their deserted houses and
gardens as trophies for the “invading horde of Lincolnites.”
But about forty houses were occupied, principally
by rabid rebel women, who, as our officers rode through
the town, betrayed evident uneasiness, rushing into their
houses in some instances, and locking their doors against
all callers who politely asked admittance. The town is
beautifully situated in the Kenesaw valley, with nearly
all the houses nestling in beautiful groves of southern
trees that gave forth fragrant odors, to mingle with the
air that is wafted to the mountain resort, where the
ladies made their lookout to witness the efforts of the
Federals to drive back Johnston and his followers. Our
troops occupied the town about ten o’clock, while the
bells of the Episcopal Church pealed out the call to public
worship. The minister and the congregation were
not interrupted in their devotions, the troops behaved
very orderly, and, after a brief rest, resumed the march
to the Chattahoochie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While here, the chieftain wrote the following noble
letter to a friend of former days, the wife of Rev. Charles
Bowen, in reply to a note reminding him of the cherished
past in their social relations, and of the melancholy present
with its cruel “Yankee invasion.”</p>

not even a pretext. Indeed, by her unjustifiable course
she has thrown away the proud history of the past, and
laid open her fair country to the tread of devastating
war. She bantered and bullied us to the conflict. Had
we declined battle, America would have sunk back,
coward and craven, meriting the contempt of all mankind.
As a nation, we were forced to accept battle, and
that once begun, it has gone on till the war has assumed
proportions at which even we in the hurly-burly sometimes
stand aghast. I would not subjugate the South in
the term so offensively assumed, but I would make every
citizen of the land obey the common law, submit to the
same that we do—no worse, no better—our equals and
not our superiors. I know and you know that there
were young men in our day, now no longer young, but
who control their fellows, who assumed to the gentlemen
of the South a superiority of courage and manhood, and
boastingly defied us of northern birth to arms. God
knows how reluctantly we accepted the issue, but once
the issue joined, like the northern race in other ages,
though slow to anger, once aroused are more terrible
than the more inflammable of the South. Even yet my
heart bleeds when I see the carnage of battle, the desolation
of homes, the bitter anguish of families; but the very
moment the men of the South say that instead of appealing
to war they should have appealed to reason, to our
Congress, to our courts, to religion, and to the experience
of history, then will I say Peace—Peace; go back to your
point of error, and resume your places as American citizens,
with all their proud heritages. Whether I shall
live to see this period is problematical, but you may, and
may tell your mother and sisters that I never forgot one
kind look or greeting, or ever wished to efface its remembrance;
but in putting on the armor of war I did it that
our common country should not perish in infamy and dishonor.
I am married, have a wife and six children living
in Lancaster, Ohio. My course has been an eventful one,
but I hope when the clouds of anger and passion are dispersed,
and truth emerges bright and clear, you and all
who knew me in early years will not blush that we were
once dear friends. Tell Eliza for me that I hope she
may live to realize that the doctrine of ‘secession’ is as
monstrous in our civil code as disobedience was in the
Divine law. And should the fortunes of war ever bring
you or your sisters, or any of our old clique under the
shelter of my authority, I do not believe they will have
cause to regret it. Give my love to your children, and
the assurance of my respects to your honored husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wrote a loyal pen in that grand cavalcade of freedom
from the heights on the banks of the Chattahoochie:
“The view is exceedingly interesting. Away off to the
southeast, ten miles distant, can be distinctly seen the
farm-houses that nestle in the forests around Atlanta—the
tall spires of the churches and public buildings, and
the fortifications that guard the approaches to the ‘Gate
City.’ Stretching away to the south, the eye beholds a
vast forest, dotted by innumerable plantations and villages.
Nearer, almost at the base of the mountain, the Serpentine
River can be seen through the thick growth of
trees that line its banks, while the military, State, and
private roads to the east and south, remind the beholder
of a huge spider’s web, so numerous are they, and forming
so many angles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the 4th the curiosity of the troops to see Atlanta
was so strong, that stragglers left their regiments and
climbed the side from which they viewed the promised
land to which they are ‘pilgrimaging.’ Many of the
poor fellows, I fear, will never live to obtain a nearer
view, as a desperate defence will be made ere Johnston
evacuates it for another position, and by surrendering it
open the doors for greater Federal success beyond and on
either side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>July 10th found General Sherman in possession of the
country north and west of the river, with only the smoking
ruins of the enemy’s bridges left to tell of his hurried
retreat toward Atlanta, for whose gates the race was renewed.
Manœuvring, marching, and skirmishing again,
marked the movements of the contending armies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall let you read further the great commander’s
own story of the chase after leaving the banks of the
river, in which he pays a passing tribute to the gallant
McPherson:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the 21st of July we felt the enemy in his intrenched
position, which was found to crown the heights
overlooking the comparatively open ground of the valley
of Peach-tree Creek, his right beyond the Augusta road
to the east, and his left well toward Turner’s Ferry, on
the Chattahoochie, at a general distance from Atlanta of
about four miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the morning of the 22d, somewhat to my surprise,
this whole line was found abandoned, and I confess
I thought the enemy had resolved to give us Atlanta
without further contest; but General Johnston had been
relieved of his command, and General Hood substituted.
A new policy seemed resolved on, of which the bold
attack on our right was the index. Our advancing ranks
swept across the strong and well-finished parapet of the
enemy, and closed in upon Atlanta, until we occupied a
line in the form of a general circle of about two miles
radius, when we again found him occupying in force
a line of finished redoubts, which had been prepared
for more than a year, covering all the roads leading into
Atlanta; and we found him also busy in connecting these
redoubts with curtains strengthened by rifle trenches,
abatis, and chevaux-de-frise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General McPherson, who had advanced from Decatur,
continued to follow substantially the railroad, with
the Fifteenth Corps, General Logan; the Seventeenth,
General Blair, on its left; and the Sixteenth, General
Dodge, on its right; but as the general advance of all
the armies contracted the circle, the Sixteenth Corps,
General Dodge, was thrown out of line by the Fifteenth
connecting on the right with General Schofield near the
Howard House. General McPherson, the night before,
had gained a high hill to the south and east of the railroad,
where the Seventeenth Corps had, after a severe
fight, driven the enemy, and it gave him a most commanding
position, within easy view of the very heart of
the city. He had thrown out working-parties to it, and
was making preparations to occupy it in strength with
batteries. The Sixteenth Corps, General Dodge, was
ordered from right to left to occupy this position and
make it a strong general, left flank. General Dodge was
moving by a diagonal path, or wagon track, leading from
the Decatur road in the direction of General Blair’s left
flank. General McPherson remained with me until near
noon, when some reports reaching us that indicated a
movement of the enemy on that flank, he mounted and
rode away with his staff. I must here also state that the
day before I had detached General Garrard’s cavalry to
go to Covington, on the Augusta road, forty-two miles
east of Atlanta, and from that point to send detachments
to break the two important bridges across the Yellow and
Ulcofauhatchee Rivers, tributaries of Ocmulgee, and General
McPherson had also left his wagon-train at Decatur
under a guard of three regiments, commanded by Colonel,
now General Sprague. Soon after General McPherson
left me at the Howard House, as before described, I
heard the sounds of musketry to our left rear—at first
mere pattering shots, but soon they grew in volume, accompanied
with artillery, and about the same time the
sound of guns was heard in the direction of Decatur.
No doubt could longer be entertained of the enemy’s plan
of action, which was to throw a superior force on our
left flank, while he held us with his forts in front, the
only question being as to the amount of force he could
employ at that point. I hastily transmitted orders to all
points of our centre and right to press forward, and to
give full employment to all the enemy in his lines, and for
General Schofield to hold as large a force in reserve as
possible, awaiting developments. Not more than half an
hour after General McPherson had left me, viz., about
12½ <span class='sc'>p. m.</span> of the 22d, his adjutant-general, Lieutenant-Colonel
Clark, rode up and reported that General McPherson
was either dead or a prisoner; that he had ridden
from me to General Dodge’s column, moving as heretofore
described, and had sent off nearly all his staff and
orderlies on various errands, and himself had passed into
a narrow path or road that led to the left and rear of
General Giles A. Smith’s division, which was General
Blair’s extreme left; that a few minutes after he had entered
the woods a sharp volley was heard in that direction,
and his horse had come out riderless, having two
wounds. The suddenness of this terrible calamity would
have overwhelmed me with grief, but the living demanded
my whole thoughts. I instantly despatched a staff officer
to General John A. Logan, commanding the Fifteenth
Corps, to tell him what had happened; that he must
assume command of the Army of the Tennessee, and
hold stubbornly the ground already chosen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But among the dead was Major-General McPherson,
whose body was recovered and brought to me in the heat
of battle, and I had it sent, in charge of his personal staff,
back to Marietta, on its way to his northern home. He
was a noble youth, of striking personal appearance, of
the highest professional capacity, and with a heart abounding
in kindness, that drew to him the affections of all men.
His sudden death devolved the command of the Army of
the Tennessee on the no less brave and gallant General
Logan, who nobly sustained his reputation and that of his
veteran army, and avenged the death of his comrade and
commander.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>What high appreciation of a gifted and gallant officer,
tender regard, and sublime self-control, are displayed in
those words from the field of carnage! Lieutenant-General
Grant was not ashamed to weep in his tent over McPherson’s
death; in the closing circle of conflict around
Atlanta, General Sherman could only feel the pang of
poignant regret, and marshal the unfallen for further and
bloodier strife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this crisis, Congress having passed a law authorizing
the organization of colored troops, a Massachusetts
State Agent applied to him to know where, in the rebel
States penetrated by our troops, would be the best points
for recruiting stations. His letter in reply will possess
interest, because while it furnishes the desired information,
it contains the writer’s views of the subject. The
best treasure, and the best blood of the nation, has been
his estimate of the great and glorious sacrifice demanded
in our struggle for national existence. He scorns all
evasions of duty, and resorts to doubtful expedients, for
relief from any of the burdens of such a war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: Yours from Chattanooga, July 28th, is received,
notifying me of your appointment by your State
as lieutenant-colonel and provost-marshal of Georgia, Alabama,
and Mississippi, under the act of Congress approved
July 4, 1864, to recruit volunteers to be credited to the
States respectively. On applying to General Webster, at
Nashville, he will grant you a pass through our lines to
those States, and, as I have had considerable experience
in those States, would suggest recruiting depots to be established
at Macon and Columbus, Miss., Selma, Montgomery,
and Mobile, Alabama, and Columbus, Milledgeville,
and Savannah, Georgia. I do not see that the law
restricts you to black recruits, but you are at liberty to
collect white recruits also. It is [a] waste of time and
money to open rendezvous in Northwest Georgia, for I
assure you I have not seen an able-bodied man, black or
white, there, fit for a soldier who was not in this army or
the one opposed to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You speak of the impression going abroad that I
am opposed to the organization of colored regiments.
My opinions are usually very positive, and there is no
reason why you should not know them. Though entertaining
profound reverence for our Congress, I do doubt
their wisdom in the passage of this law:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“1st. Because civilian agents about an army are a
nuisance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“2d. The duty of citizens to fight for their country
is too sacred a one to be peddled off by buying up the
refuse of other States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“3d. It is unjust to the brave soldiers and volunteers
who are fighting, as those who compose this army do, to
place them on a par with the class of recruits you are after.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“4th. The negro is in a transition state, and is not
the equal of the white man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“5th. He is liberated from his bondage by the act
of war; and the armies in the field are entitled to all his
assistance and labor and fighting <span class='it'>in addition</span> to the proper
quotas of the States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“6th. This bidding and bantering for recruits, white
and black, has delayed the reënforcement of our armies
at the times when such reënforcements would have
enabled us to make our successes permanent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“7th. The law is an experiment which, pending war,
is unwise and unsafe, and has delayed the universal draft
which I firmly believe will become necessary to overcome
the wide-spread resistance offered us; and I also
believe the universal draft will be wise and beneficial;
for under the Providence of God it will separate the
sheep from the goats, and demonstrate what citizens will
fight for their country, and what will only talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No one will infer from this that I am not a friend
to the negro as well as the white race. I contend that
the treason and rebellion of the master freed the slave,
and the armies I have commanded have conducted to safe
points more negroes than those of any general officer in
the army; but I prefer negroes for pioneers, teamsters,
cooks, and servants, others gradually to experiment in
the art of the soldier, beginning with the duties of local
garrisons, such as we had at Memphis, Vicksburg,
Natchez, Nashville, and Chattanooga; but I would not
draw on the poor race for too large a proportion of its
active, athletic young men, for some must remain to seek
new homes and provide for the old and young, the feeble
and helpless. These are some of my peculiar notions,
but I assure you they are shared by a large proportion
of our fighting men.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>The honesty, directness, and philanthropy of these
views, will command respect from those who opposed
them, and would raise an army of emancipated slaves.
With him it was not contempt of the negro, but the
scorn of a timid, easy policy by the North, while exactly
the opposite course was taken by the South.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Sherman now ordered from Chattanooga four
rifled cannon, whose calibre was four and a half inches,
and whose signals of his arrival were to be dropped into
streets of Atlanta. August 10th, these messengers of
<span class='it'>peace with victory</span>, arrived and began their negotiations.
Night and day they sent their globes of fire into the city,
kindling conflagrations and spreading confusion and
terror on every hand. But the enemy had come to the
strongest position along the entire war-path between
Chattanooga and the ocean; and although the “Gate
City” was made a heap of ruins, he was resolved to
hold the forts, which would guard the way, even over the
smoking embers of destruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fine cavalry officer, General Stoneman, was sent
on a raid to the Macon Railroad, in which he was taken
prisoner. This had so elated the rebels they began to
think of “turning the tables” on General Sherman.
Suddenly Major-General Wheeler appeared before Dalton,
which you recollect was the first important position
taken after leaving Chattanooga, with a force of infantry
and cavalry variously reported at from seventeen hundred
to five thousand men. It was defended by a garrison
of four hundred men under Colonel Seibold. Approaching
the town in line of battle, General Wheeler
demanded the surrender of the place in the following
terms: “To prevent the effusion of blood, I have the
honor to demand the immediate and unconditional surrender
of the forces under your command at this garrison.”
To which Colonel Seibold replied: “I have been
placed here to defend the post, but not to surrender it.
B. Seibold, commanding U. S. forces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the receipt of this reply, an attack was made on
the garrison, who retired into their defences, where they
succeeded in holding their position until the arrival of
General Steedman with reënforcements from Chattanooga,
when the rebels were forced to retreat after inflicting
some slight damage to the railroad track near
Dalton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days later General Sherman issued orders for
a general advance of the army by the right flank. All
the sick, with surplus wagons and encumbrances of every
kind, were sent back to the intrenched position near the
river bridge, reducing the number of wagons to three
thousand and of ambulances to one thousand; and on the
night of August 25th the canvas city gave place to the
marshalled host, moving forward in the darkness to
gather more closely the fatal cordon around Atlanta.
The following night flung its shadows upon the still
marching thousands, getting nearer and nearer the throat
of the foe. The Army of the Tennessee moved to the
West Point Railroad, when General Sherman ordered
“a day’s work to be expended in destroying the road,
and it was done with a will,” to use his own words.
Having surveyed in person the ruins, and satisfied with
the thoroughness of the devastation, he led the whole
army forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Howard moved on the right toward Jonesboro’,
General Thomas had the centre, whose goal was
Conch’s, on the Decatur and Fayetteville road, and General
Schofield the extreme left. To get a clear impression
of the army operations here, you will need the help
of a large map, on which the railroads and towns about
Atlanta can be seen in their relation to it. Meanwhile
General Hood was growing merry over a fancied retreat by
the manœuvring and confident Sherman. The long trains
moving to the rear, and the course of the battalions backward
toward Sandtown on the Chattahochie, <span class='it'>looked</span> like
it. But the commander knew his enemy and the way
to trap him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>August 28th, the grand army was keeping cheerful
step to the music of the march to conflict and victory;
the long columns of warriors proudly gazing after their
chief, who with equal pride cared for and led them to the
fields of conquest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Atlanta was now the object of enthusiastic interest.
It was profound strategy which divided the rebel forces
at Jonesboro’ and Atlanta, throwing the Union army like
a wedge between them, thus making the fall of Atlanta
certain: “During the night of the 28th, the rest
of the army being well under way, the Twenty-third
Corps withdrew and followed the general movement
toward the Macon Road, General Schofield timing his
movements with the corps further on the left, which had
the longer arc of the circle to traverse. The general line
of march for the Twenty-third Corps was toward the
junction of the two railroads at East Point, the Third
division, under General Cox, holding the advance, and
with the Second Division, under General Hascall, occasionally
erecting temporary works to guard against
threatened attacks from the enemy, who were on the
alert against this demonstration. On the 31st these two
divisions effected a junction with General Stanley, of the
Fourth Corps. General Hascall’s division went into
position to guard the left toward East Point, and General
Cox pushed forward toward the Macon road, which was
reached by two or three o’clock <span class='sc'>p. m.</span>, General Stanley,
of the Fourth Corps, striking it about the same time.
The troops of these two corps at once set to work fortifying,
while details were sent out, which destroyed the
track for miles. No opposition was encountered, and by
dark strong works had been thrown up, facing east and
south, the work of destruction on the railroad being continued
through the night. On the morning of the 1st of
September, Newton’s and Kimball’s divisions were marched
along the line of the railroad the length of a brigade
front, and at a given signal the ties and rails were lifted
from their bed, piled up and burnt. Thus a mile and a
half was turned up and destroyed in half an hour. An
advance of another mile and a half was then made down
the road, and the operation repeated. Thus alternately
marching and destroying the road, the two divisions
marched a distance of ten miles, to within two miles of
Jonesboro’, where they formed a junction with the Fourteenth
Corps. Soon after the Twenty-third Corps, which
followed the Fourth, came into position on its left. Further
to the left was the Army of Tennessee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Previous to this the enemy had discovered the direction
of General Sherman’s march, and two corps under
Hardee had been sent to confront him at Jonesboro’,
Hood meanwhile remaining for the defence of Atlanta.
Daring the night of August 30th the march of a rebel
column was heard on our left and centre, and in the
morning two corps were found massed on our right. At
daybreak, the Second brigade of Hazen’s division of the
Fifteenth Corps advanced and drove the enemy from a
hill, which gave, our artillery command at Jonesboro’,
and the railroad less than one half mile distant. This
success was immediately followed up by the reënforcement
of the brigade holding the hill, by a brigade from
Osterhaus’ division. Toward three <span class='sc'>p. m.</span> the enemy appeared
in front of Hazen’s position, Lee’s corps advancing
to the assault through a field of corn, while Hardee’s
Corps attempted a flanking movement on the right, which
was checked by Harrow’s division. Both divisions were
soon engaged in checking the desperate and determined
assault with which the enemy sought to overwhelm them.
The rebels were driven back, only to rally again and
again for the assault, until after two hours of desperate
fighting they were finally repulsed. They had fortunately
struck a position which we held too strongly to be
easily dislodged. A reënforcement of two regiments
were sent during the attack, by General Howard to General
Wood, and a brigade of the Seventeenth Corps,
Colonel Bryant’s, to General Hazen. Failing in this
assault, Cleburne’s rebel division marched to our extreme
right, and assaulted Kilpatrick, who held the bridge on
Flint River. General Kilpatrick succeeded, however, in
holding his position until relieved by General Giles B.
Smith’s division.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“During the night Hardee despatched Lee’s corps to
look after the safety of Atlanta, so that but a single rebel
corps was found opposed to our army on the morning of
September 1st. This corps lay in position in front of
Jonesboro’, with their right resting on the railroad.
Having failed in the assault with which they hoped to
drive back our army, they were prepared to resist its
further advance in the best position they could secure.
They had a large number of guns in position, which did
effective service during the day. Late in the afternoon
General Davis formed his troops for a charge upon the
enemy’s position; Brigadier-General Carlin’s division on
the left, and Brigadier-General Morgan, joining the
Fifteenth Corps on the right, General Baird being in
reserve. The line was formed in the arc of a circle on
the edge of the woods, the two flanks thrown forward
overlapping the enemy, who held a position on some commanding
ridges in front, covering Jonesboro’. In the
face of a deadly fire of musketry, shell, and canister, the
gallant Fourteenth Corps charged upon the rebel position,
driving them from their breastworks and capturing many
prisoners, including Brigadier-General Govan, several colonels
and other commissioned officers. Eight guns were
also taken, among them part of Loomis’s battery captured
at Chickamauga. The troops captured belonged to the
fighting division of Cleburne. The approach of night prevented
pursuit of the broken columns of the rebels, who
escaped under cover of the darkness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At daybreak on the 2d, the Fourth and Twenty-third
Corps advanced in pursuit of the retreating rebels, who
came to bay near Lovejoy’s Station, six miles beyond
Jonesboro’, toward Macon, taking position on a wooded
ridge behind a swamp bordering a creek. Some skirmishing
was had with the enemy’s first line until night, which
was spent by our troops in intrenching. The enemy being
found in strong position, and his retreat being assured, no
further advance was attempted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meantime Atlanta was alive with excitement. Despair
had succeeded confidence as it became known that
Hardee had been driven from Jonesboro’ south, while
Hood was left in Atlanta with his communications severed,
and our army threatening both from the north and
the south. Early on Thursday, September 1st, the removal
of supplies and ammunition commenced, and was
continued through the day. Large quantities of provisions
that could not be removed were distributed to the citizens,
the storehouses at the same time being thrown open to the
troops as they passed through the city. The rolling stock
of the railroad, consisting of about one hundred cars and
six engines, was gathered together and destroyed. The
cars were laden with the surplus ammunition taken out
on the Augusta Railroad, and set on fire and blown up,
making the earth tremble with the explosion. Over one
thousand bales of cotton were also given to the torch.
The scene of confusion and excitement among the town’s
people when it became evident that the city was to be
evacuated, is beyond description. Every possible and
impossible vehicle was brought into requisition to carry
away the effects of the inhabitants, who, in sorrowful
procession, took up their line of march toward the
South. For the third time the peripatetic Memphis
<span class='it'>Appeal</span> was on the wing, its editor reporting himself at
this time ‘thoroughly demoralized.’ From the shanties
and cellars of the city swarmed out the lower classes of
the population to seize what they could from the general
wreck. The explosion of ammunition was heard by General
Slocum, of the Twentieth Corps, seven miles distant.
Suspecting the cause, he sent out a heavy column to reconnoitre
at daybreak on the morning of the 2d instant.
They met with no opposition, and pushed forward on the
roads leading into Atlanta from the north and northwest.
Arriving near the city, they were met by the mayor, Mr.
Calhoun, who formally surrendered the city. The formalities
disposed of, our troops entered Atlanta with banners
flying and music playing, the inhabitants looking on in
silence. General Slocum established his headquarters at
the Trout House, the principal hotel of the city. Eleven
heavy guns, mostly sixty-six pounders, were found in the
forts of the city, and others were subsequently discovered
buried in fictitious graves. About three thousand muskets,
in good order, and three locomotives were also secured,
besides large quantities of manufactured tobacco.
About two hundred rebel stragglers were gathered up by
the Second Massachusetts, which was detailed for provost
duty, its colonel, Cogswell, being appointed provost-marshal.
But a small proportion of the inhabitants remained
in the city, and these principally of the lower
classes, and tradesmen who proposed to make an honest
penny out of the army. Their hopes were speedily cut
short by a peremptory order from General Sherman ordering
all civilians from the city.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In looking back upon this campaign, a very remarkable
feature of it was the protection of his line of communication:
“It was not a little precarious, and more
than once aroused the anxiety of the nation. It might
well occasion solicitude. His base was, in one sense, not
at Chattanooga, but at Nashville; with the former point
as a secondary base. Accordingly, the enemy bent his
efforts not only to breaking the railroad between Atlanta
and Ringgold, striking it at Dalton and Calhoun, but also
to raiding on the road from Chattanooga back to Nashville.
From Atlanta to Chattanooga the railroad is one
hundred and thirty-five miles long; from Chattanooga to
Nashville, only a little less. With this line of two hundred
and fifty miles, stretched clear across the great Alleghany
chain from flank to flank, in a disputed country,
filled with guerrillas and hostile inhabitants, with myriads
of nooks and eyries in the mountainous region, apt for
the assemblage and protection of marauding bands, with
that attenuated line infested by many squadrons of the
best cavalry in the Confederacy, long accustomed to be
victorious everywhere—cavalry who had devastated almost
with impunity the broad States of Kentucky and Tennessee
again and again, under such bold and skilful leaders
as John Morgan, Forrest, Wheeler, Stephen Lee, Rhoddy,
and Chalmers—in spite of all, for four eventful months,
through victory and repulse, in action and repose alike,
Sherman has been able to keep his lines strong and clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While all the Southern newspapers and many Southern
generals, and while even English journals of great
ability were proving by all the laws of logic and strategy
that Sherman <span class='it'>must</span> now retreat, Sherman did not retreat.
At the very moment, indeed, when the exultation of the
Confederates was the highest at the absolute certainty of
his downfall, Sherman pushed on and took Atlanta, ending
logic and campaign both at once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was one of the grandest, most decisive and exciting
scenes of the civil war, when the great leader of the Union
battalions in Georgia enjoyed the pause in marches and
battles afforded by the occupation of Atlanta. The sound
of booming cannon, the crack of musketry, all the Babel
discord of war, was comparatively hushed. In the distance
the foe was reluctantly, slowly retreating; and
along the track of both armies the new-made graves and
the wounded were lying, the waymarks of a gigantic
struggle for</p>

with despondency and wrath the faces of

<p class='pindent'>“The officers and soldiers of the Armies of the Cumberland,
Ohio, and Tennessee, have, already received the
thanks of the Nation, through its President and Commander-in-Chief,
and it now remains only for him who
has been with you from the beginning, and who intends
to stay all the time, to thank the officers and men for
their intelligence, fidelity, and courage displayed in the
campaign of Atlanta.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the 1st of May our armies were lying in garrison,
seemingly quiet from Knoxville to Huntsville, and our
enemy lay behind his rocky-faced barrier at Dalton,
proud, defiant, and exulting. He had had time since
Christmas to recover from his discomfiture on the Mission
Ridge, with his ranks filled, and a new commander-in-chief,
second to none of the Confederacy in reputation
for skill, sagacity, and extreme popularity. All at once
our armies assumed life and action, and appeared before
Dalton; threatening Rocky Face we threw ourselves upon
Resaca, and the rebel army only escaped by the rapidity
of its retreat, aided by the numerous roads with which he
was familiar, and which were strange to us. Again he
took position in Allatoona, but we gave him no rest, and
by a circuit toward Dallas and subsequent movement to
Ackworth, we gained the Allatoona Pass. Then followed
the eventful battles about Kenesaw, and the escape of
the enemy across Chattahoochie River.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The crossing of the Chattahoochie and breaking of
the Augusta road was most handsomely executed by us,
and will be studied as an example in the art of war. At
this stage of our game our enemies became dissatisfied
with their old and skilful commander, and selected one
more bold and rash. New tactics were adopted. Hood
first boldly and rapidly, on the 20th of July, fell on our
right at Peach Tree Creek, and lost. Again, on the 22d,
he struck our extreme left, and was severely punished;
and finally, again on the 28th he repeated the attempt on
our right, and that time must have been satisfied; for
since that date he has remained on the defensive. We
slowly and gradually drew our lines about Atlanta, feeling
for the railroads which supplied the rebel army and
made Atlanta a place of importance. We must concede
to our enemy that he met these efforts patiently and skilfully,
but at last he made the mistake we had waited for
so long, and sent his cavalry to our rear, far beyond the
reach of recall. Instantly our cavalry was on his only
remaining road, and we followed quickly with our principal
army, and Atlanta fell into our possession as the
fruit of well-concerted measures, backed by a brave and
confident army. This completed the grand task which
had been assigned us by our Government, and your general
again repeats his personal and official thanks to all
the officers and men composing this army, for the indomitable
courage and perseverance which alone could
give success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have beaten our enemy on every ground he has
chosen, and have wrested from him his own Gate City,
where were located his foundries, arsenals, and workshops,
deemed secure on account of their distance from
our base, and the seemingly impregnable obstacles intervening.
Nothing is impossible to an army like this, determined
to vindicate a Government which has rights
wherever our flag has once floated, and is resolved to
maintain them at any and all costs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In our campaign many, yea, very many of our
noble and gallant comrades have preceded us to our common
destination, the grave; but they have left the memory
of deeds on which a nation can build a proud history.
McPherson, Harker, McCook, and others dear to us all,
are now the binding links in our minds that should attach
more closely together the living, who have to complete
the task which still lies before us in the dim future. I
ask all to continue as they have so well begun, the cultivation
of the soldierly virtues that have ennobled our own
and other countries. Courage, patience, obedience to the
laws and constituted authorities of our Government; fidelity
to our trusts and good feeling among each other; each
trying to excel the other in the practice of those high
qualities, and it will then require no prophet to foretell
that our country will in time emerge from this war purified
by the fires of war and worthy its great founder—Washington.</p>

for he excels in the use of <span class='it'>both</span>, as the Georgia campaign
and letters will show. The annals of war have no finer
productions of cultivated genius from the plains of death
and victory. The following orders opened the spirited

<p class='pindent'>“1. The city of Atlanta being exclusively required
for warlike purposes, will at once be vacated by all except
the armies of the United States, and such civilian
employés as may be retained by the proper departments
of Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“2. The chief quartermaster, Colonel Easton, will at
once take possession of buildings of all kinds, and of all
staple article, such as cotton, tobacco, &amp;c., and will
make such dispositions of them as are required by existing
regulations, or such orders as he may receive from
time to time from the proper authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“3. The chief engineer will promptly reconnoitre the
city and suburbs, and indicate the sites needed for the
permanent defence of the place, together with any houses
or other buildings that stand in his way, that they may
be set apart for destruction. Colonel Easton will then,
on consultation with the proper officers of the ordnance,
quartermaster, medical, and railroad departments, set
aside such buildings and lots of ground as will be needed
for them, and have them suitably marked and set apart;
he will then, in consultation with Generals Thomas and
Slocum, set apart such as may be necessary to the proper
administration of the military duties of the department of
the Cumberland and of the post of Atlanta, and all
buildings and materials not thus embraced will be held
subject to the use of the Government, as may hereafter
arise, according to the just rules of the quartermaster’s
department.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“4. No general, staff, or other officer, or any soldier,
will, on any pretence, occupy any house or shanty, unless
it be embraced in the limits assigned as the camp of the
troops to which such general or staff belongs. But the
chief quartermaster may allow the troops to use boards,
shingles, or other materials of building, barns, sheds,
warehouses and shanties, not needed by the proper departments
of Government, to be used in the reconstruction
of quarters and barracks as the troops and officers serving
with them require. And he will also provide, as
early as practicable, the proper allowance of tents for the
use of the officers and men in their encampments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“5. In proper time, just arrangements will be made
for the supply to the troops of all articles they may need
over and above the clothing, provisions, &amp;c., furnished
by the Government; and on no pretence whatever will
traders, manufacturers, or suttlers, be allowed to sell in
the limits of fortified places; and if they manage to come
in spite of this notice, the quartermaster will seize their
stores and appropriate them to the use of the troops, and
deliver the parties or other unauthorized citizens, who
thus place their individual interest above that of the
United States, into the hands of some provost-marshal, to
be put to labor on the forts, or conscripted into one of the
regiments or batteries already in service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The message addressed to the enemy contained the
following words, which were like oil to the fire on the
defeated General’s smothered wrath: “All citizens are
required to leave Atlanta and proceed either South or
North. The Government will furnish transportation
South as far as Rough and Ready, and North as far as
Chattanooga. All citizens may take their movable property
with them. Transportation will be furnished for
all movables. Negroes who wish to do so may go
with their masters. Other male negroes will be put in
Government employ. Negro women and children will
be sent out of the lines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I enclose you a copy of my orders, which will, I am
satisfied, accomplish my purpose perfectly. You style
the measures proposed ‘unprecedented,’ and appeal to
the dark history of war for a parallel, as an act of
‘studied and ungenerous cruelty.’ It is not unprecedented,
for General Johnston himself very wisely and
properly removed the families all the way from Dalton
down, and I see no reason why Atlanta should be excepted.
Nor is it necessary to appeal to the ‘dark history
of war,’ when recent and modern examples are so
handy. You yourself burned dwelling-houses along your
parapet, and I saw to-day fifty houses that you have rendered
uninhabitable because they stood in the way of
your forts and men. You defended Atlanta on a line so
close to the town that every cannon-shot and many musket-shots
from our line of investment, that overshot their
mark, went into the habitations of women and children.
General Hardee did the same at Jonesboro’, and General
Johnston did the same last summer at Jackson, Miss.;
I have not accused them of heartless cruelty, but merely
instance these cases of very recent occurrence, and could
go on and enumerate hundreds of others, and challenge
any fair man to judge which of us has the heart of pity
for the families of ‘a brave people.’ I say it is kindness
to the families of Atlanta to remove them now at once
from scenes that women and children should not be exposed
to, and the ‘brave people’ should scorn to commit
their wives and children to the rude barbarians who thus,
as you say, violate the laws of war, as illustrated in the
pages of its ‘dark history.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the name of common sense, I ask you not to appeal
to a just God in such a sacrilegious manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You who in the midst of peace and prosperity have
plunged a nation into war, ‘dark and cruel war;’ who
dared and badgered us to battle, insulted our flag; seized
our arsenals and forts that were left in the honorable
custody of a peaceful ordnance sergeant; seized and made
prisoners of war the very garrisons sent to protect your
people against negroes and Indians, long before any overt
act was committed by the (to you) hateful Lincoln Government;
tried to force Kentucky and Missouri into rebellion
in despite of themselves; falsified the vote of
Louisiana; turned loose your privateers to plunder unarmed
ships; expelled Union families by the thousands;
burned their homes, and declared, by an act of your Congress,
the confiscation of all debts due to Northern men
for goods had and received! Talk this to the marines,
but not to me, who have seen these things, and who will
this day make as great sacrifice for the peace and honor

and Major-General W. T. Sherman, commanding this
army, a truce is hereby declared to exist from daylight
of Monday, September 12, until daylight of Thursday,

Macon Railroad known as Rough and Ready, and the
country round about or a circle of two (2) miles radius,
together with the roads leading to and from, in the direction
of Atlanta and Lovejoy station, respectively, for the
purpose of affording the people of Atlanta a safe means

Easton, will afford all the citizens of Atlanta who elect
to go South all the facilities he can spare to remove them
comfortably and safely, with their effects, to Rough and
Ready station, using cars and ambulances for that purpose;
and commanders of regiments and brigades may
use their regimental and staff teams to carry out the object
of this order; the whole to cease after Wednesday,

established on the road out beyond the camp-ground, with
orders to allow all wagons and vehicles to pass that are
used manifestly for this purpose; and Major-General
Howard will send a guard of one hundred men, with a
field officer in command, to take post at Rough and
Ready during the truce, with orders in concert with a
guard from the Confederate army of like size, to maintain
the most perfect order in that vicinity during the
transfer of these families. A white flag will be displayed
during the truce, and a guard will cause all wagons to

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Atlanta, Ga.</span>, <span class='it'>September 11</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;'>“<span class='it'>Major-General W. T. Sherman</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: The undersigned mayor, and two members of
council for the city of Atlanta, for the time being the
only legal organ of the people of the said city, to express
their wants and wishes, ask leave most earnestly, but respectfully,
to petition you to reconsider the order requiring
them to leave Atlanta. At first view it struck us
that the measure would involve extraordinary hardship
and loss, but since we have seen the practical execution
of it, so far as it has progressed, and the individual condition
of many of the people, and heard their statements
as to the inconveniences, loss, and suffering attending
it, we are satisfied that the amount of it will involve in
the aggregate consequences appalling and heartrending.
Many poor women are in an advanced state of pregnancy;
others now having young children, and whose husbands
are either in the army, prisoners, or dead. Some say:
‘I have such a one sick at home; who will wait on them
when I am gone?’ Others say: ‘What are we to do?
We have no houses to go to, and no means to buy, build,
or to rent any—no parents, friends, or relatives to go to.’
Another says: ‘I will try and take this or that article of
property, but such and such things I must leave behind,
though I need them much.’ We reply to them: ‘General
Sherman will carry your property to Rough and Ready,
and General Hood will take it there on.’ And they will
reply to this: ‘But I want to leave the railroad at such a
point, and cannot get conveyance from there on.’ We
only refer to a few facts to try to illustrate in part how
the measure will operate in practice. As you advanced,
the people north of us fell back, and before your arrival
here a large portion of the people had retired south, so
that the country south of this is already crowded, and
without houses to accommodate the people, and we are
informed that many are now staying in churches and
other out-buildings. This being so, how is it possible for
the people still here (mostly women and children) to find
any shelter? and how can they live through the winter in
the woods—no shelter or subsistence—in the midst of
strangers who know them not, and without the power to
assist them, if they were willing to do so? This is but a
feeble picture of the consequences of this measure. You
know the woe, the horror, and the suffering cannot be
described by words. Imagination can only conceive of it,
and we ask you to take these things into consideration.
We know your mind and time are constantly occupied
with the duties of your command, which almost deter us
from asking your attention to this matter; but thought it
might be that you had not considered the subject in all its
awful consequences, and that on more reflection, you, we
hope, would not make this people an exception to all mankind,
for we know of no such instance ever having occurred—surely
none such in the United States; and what has
this helpless people done, that they should be driven from
their homes, to wander as strangers, outcasts, and exiles,
and to subsist on charity? We do not know, as yet, the
number of people still here. Of those who are here we
are satisfied a respectably number, if allowed to remain
at home, could subsist for several months without assistance,
and a respectable number for a much longer time,
and who might not need assistance at any time. In conclusion,
we most earnestly and solemnly petition you to
reconsider this order, or modify it, and suffer this unfortunate
people to remain at home and enjoy what little
means they have. Respectfully submitted,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='it'>representing City Council of Atlanta</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Gentlemen</span>: I have your letter of the 11th, in the
nature of a petition to revoke my order removing all the
inhabitants from Atlanta. I have read it carefully, and
give full credit to your statements of the distress that will
be occasioned by it, and yet shall not revoke my order,
simply because my orders are not designed to meet the
humanities of the case, but to prepare for the future
struggle in which millions, yea, hundreds of millions of
good people outside of Atlanta have a deep interest. We
must have peace, not only in Atlanta, but in all America.
To secure this, we must stop the war that now desolates
our once happy and favored country. To stop the war, we
must defeat the rebel armies that are arrayed against the
laws and Constitution which all men must respect and
obey. To defeat these armies, we must prepare the way
to reach them in their recesses, provided with the arms
and instruments which enable us to accomplish our purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now I know the vindictive nature of our enemy,
and that we may have many years of military operations
from this quarter, and therefore deem it wise and prudent
to prepare in time. The use of Atlanta for warlike purposes
is inconsistent with its character as a home for
families. There will be no manufactures, commerce, or
agriculture here for the maintenance of families, and,
sooner or later, want will compel the inhabitants to
go. Why not go now, when all the arrangements are
completed for the transfer, instead of waiting until the
plunging shot of contending armies will renew the scenes
of the past month? Of course I do not apprehend any
such thing at this moment, but you do not suppose this
army will be here till the war is over? I cannot discuss
this subject with you fairly, because I cannot impart to
you what I propose to do; but I assert that my military
plans make it necessary for the inhabitants to go away,
and I can only renew my offer of services to make their
exodus in any direction as easy and comfortable as possible.
You cannot qualify war in harsher terms than I
will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it; and those
who brought war on our country deserve all the curses
and maledictions a people can pour out. I know I had
no hand in making this war, and I know that I will make
more sacrifices than any of you to-day to secure peace.
But you cannot have peace and a division of our country.
If the United States submits to a division now, it
will not stop, but will go on till we reap the fate of Mexico,
which is eternal war. The United States does and must
assert its authority wherever it has power; if it relaxes
one bit of pressure it is gone, and I know that such is not
the national feeling. This feeling assumes various shapes,
but always comes back to that of <span class='it'>Union</span>. Once admit
the Union, once more acknowledge the authority of the
National Government, and instead of devoting your
houses and streets and roads to the dread uses of war,
I and this army become at once your protectors and supporters,
shielding you from danger, let it come from what
quarter it may. I know that a few individuals cannot
resist a torrent of error and passion such as has swept
the South into rebellion; but you can point out, so that
we may know those who desire a Government, and those
who insist on war and its desolation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You might as well appeal against the thunder-storm
as against the terrible hardships of war. They are inevitable,
and the only way the people of Atlanta can hope
once more to live in peace and quiet at home, is to stop
this war, which can alone be done by admitting that it
began in error, and is perpetuated in pride. We don’t
want your negroes, or your horses, or your houses, or
your land, or anything you have; but we do want and
will have a just obedience to the laws of the United
States. That we will have; and if it involves the destruction
of your improvements, we cannot help it. You have
heretofore read public sentiment in your newspapers, that
live by falsehood and excitement, and the quicker you
seek for truth in other quarters the better for you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I repeat, then, that by the original compact of government,
the United States had certain rights in Georgia
which have never been relinquished, and never will be;
that the South began the war by seizing forts, arsenals,
mints, custom houses, &amp;c., long before Mr. Lincoln was
installed, and before the South had one jot or tittle of
provocation. I myself have seen in Missouri, Kentucky,
Tennessee, and Mississippi, hundreds and thousands
of women and children fleeing from your armies
and desperadoes, hungry, and with bleeding feet. In
Memphis, Vicksburg, and Mississippi, we fed thousands
upon thousands of the families of rebel soldiers left on
our hands, and whom we could not see starve. Now that
war comes home to you, you feel very different—you deprecate
its horrors, but did not feel them when you sent
carloads of soldiers and ammunition, and moulded shells
and shot to carry war into Kentucky and Tennessee, and
desolate the homes of hundreds and thousands of good
people, who only asked to live in peace at their old homes,
and under the Government of their inheritance. But
these comparisons are idle. I want peace, and believe it
only can be reached through Union and war, and I will
ever conduct war purely with a view to perfect and early
success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, my dear sirs, when that peace does come, you
may call on me for anything. Then will I share with
you the last cracker, and watch with you to shield your
homes and families against danger from every quarter.
Now you must go, and take with you the old and feeble;
feed and nurse them, and build for them in more quiet
places proper habitations to shield them against the
weather, until the mad passions of men cool down, and
allow the Union and peace once more to settle on your
old homes at Atlanta.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next effort of his facile pen corrects a falsehood
which had been copied from a rebel paper:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Atlanta</span>, <span class='it'>Sept. 24, 1864</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;font-size:.8em;'>“<span class='it'>To the Louisville Agent of the New York Associated Press</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your press despatches of the 21st embrace one from
Macon, of the 14th, announcing the arrival of the first
train of refugees from Atlanta, with this addition, ‘that
they were robbed of everything before being sent into the
rebel lines.’ Of course, that is false; and it is idle to
correct it so far as the rebels are concerned, for they
purposed it as a falsehood, to create a mischievous public
opinion. The truth is, that during the truce, 446
families were moved South, making 705 adults, 860
children, and 479 servants, with 1,651 pounds of furniture
and household goods on the average for each family,
of which we have a perfect recollection by name and articles.
At the end of the truce, Colonel Warner, of my staff,
who had general supervision of the business, received from

to close, you will permit me to bear testimony to the
uniform courtesy you have shown on all occasions to me

<p class='pindent'>“I would not notice this, but I know the people of

<p class='pindent'>The congratulations of the heroic, devoutly Christian
General Howard, who is equally at home in the Sabbath
school and in the smoke of battle, will add to the interest
of the records of this eventful time:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“It is with pride, gratification, and a sense of Divine
favor, that I congratulate this noble army upon the successful
termination of the campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your officers claim for you a wonderful record—for
example, a march of four hundred miles, thirteen distinct
engagements, four thousand prisoners, and twenty stands
of colors captured, and three thousand of the enemy’s
dead buried in your front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your movements upon the enemy’s flank have been
bold and successful; first upon Resaca, second upon Dallas,
third upon Kenesaw, fourth upon Nickajack, fifth,
via Roswell, upon the Augusta Railroad, sixth upon
‘Ezra Church,’ to the southwest of Atlanta, and seventh
upon Jonesboro’ and the Macon Railroad. Atlanta was
evacuated while you were fighting at Jonesboro’.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The country may never know with what patience,
labor, and exposure you have tugged away at every natural
and artificial obstacle that an enterprising and confident
enemy could interpose. The terrific battles you
have fought may never be realized or credited; still a
glad acclaim is already greeting you from the Government
and people, in view of the results you have helped
to gain; and I believe a sense of the magnitude of the
achievements of the last hundred days will not abate, but
increase with time and history.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our rejoicing is tempered, as it always must be, by
the soldier’s sorrow at the loss of his companions in arms.
On every hillside, in every valley throughout your long
and circuitous route, from Dalton to Jonesboro’, you have
buried them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your trusted and beloved commander fell in your
midst; his name, the name of <span class='sc'>McPherson</span>, carries with
it a peculiar feeling of sorrow. I trust the impress of his
character is upon you all, to incite you to generous actions
and noble deeds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To mourning friends, and to all the disabled in
battle, you extend a soldier’s sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My first intimate acquaintance with you dates from
the 28th of July. I never beheld fiercer assaults than
the enemy then made, and I never saw troops more
steady and self-possessed in action than your divisions
which were then engaged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have learned that for cheerfulness, obedience,
rapidity of movement and confidence in battle, the army
of the Tennessee is not to be surpassed, and it shall be
my study that your fair record shall continue, and my
purpose to assist you to move steadily forward and plant

<p class='pindent'>The most decided and pleasing evidence of the manly
and magnanimous heart of the conqueror, is given by the
enemy himself. In his despatches, General Sherman
sends the following note:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Atlanta</span>, <span class='it'>Sept. 26</span>.</p>

from the authorities at Atlanta, has just been received in

you a copy of the mayor’s letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘On leaving Atlanta, I should return my thanks to
General Sherman, General Slocum, General Ward,
Colonel Colburn, Major Beck, Captain Mott, and other
officers, with whom I have had business transactions in
carrying out the orders of General Sherman for the removal
of the citizens, and in transacting my private business,
for their kindness to, and their patience in answering
the many inquiries I had to make on the duration of
the delicate and arduous duties devolving on me as mayor

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similar testimony appeared in the columns of rebel
newspapers. The next quotation is from the Macon
<span class='it'>Telegraph</span>: “Refugees report generally kind personal
treatment from General Sherman and his officers.
Whatever exceptions may have occurred have been in
violation of orders—instances of individual pilfering,
which cannot always be prevented in an army, and in
many cases have been detected and punished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A friend, whose wife was left an invalid in Atlanta,
and came within our lines a day or two since, says, that
at her request General Sherman came to see her, and
finding her unable to attend to the arrangement of her
movables for transportation, had them all bound up nicely
and transported to our lines, even to her washtub.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Federal general had three hours’ conversation
with her, and justified at length his order for the removal,
insisting that in his exposed position, liable to be cut off
and besieged, it was the part of humanity to require that
non-combatants should not be exposed to the privations
and perils to which his army must probably be subjected;
and worse, because he could not provide food for a large
population. Goods left behind were stored and duplicate
receipts given, with the promise that they should be safely
returned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Refugees report that Sherman’s army is going North
by thousands, and his force is now very small. Whether
this movement is confined to men going out of service, or
embraces reënforcements to Grant, they were unable to
say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I must give you a pleasant picture of the chief while
marshalling his troops at Atlanta: “While I was watching
to-day the endless line of troops shifting by, an officer
with a modest escort rode up to the fence near which I
was standing, and dismounted. He was rather tall and
slender, and his quick movements denoted good muscle
added to absolute leanness—not thinness. His uniform
was neither new nor old, but bordering on a hazy mellowness
of gloss, while the elbows and knees were a little
accented from the continuous agitation of those joints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The face was one I should never rest upon in a
crowd, simply because, to my eye, there was nothing remarkable
in it save the nose, which organ was high, thin,
and planted with a curve as vehement as the curl of a
Malay cutlass. The face and neck were rough and
covered with reddish hair, the eye light in color and animated;
but, though restless and bounding like a ball from
one object to another, neither piercing nor brilliant; the
mouth well closed but common, the ears large, the hands
and feet long and thin, the gait a little rolling, but firm
and active. In dress and manner there was not the
slightest trace of pretension. He spoke rapidly, and generally
with an inquisitive smile. To this <span class='it'>ensemble</span> I must
add a hat which was the reverse of dignified or distinguished—a
simple felt affair, with a round crown and
drooping brim—and you have as fair a description of
General Sherman’s externals as I can pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seating himself on a stick of cordwood hard by the
fence, he drew a bit of pencil from his pocket, and spreading
a piece of note paper on his knee, he wrote with great
rapidity. Long columns of troops lined the road a few
yards in his front, and beyond the road, massed in a
series of spreading green fields, a whole division of infantry
was waiting to take up the line of march, the blue
ranks clear cut against the verdant background. Those
who were near their general looked at him curiously; for
in so vast an army the soldier sees his commander-in-chief
but seldom. Page after page was filled by the general’s
nimble pencil, and despatched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a half hour I watched him, and, though I looked
for and expected to find them, no symptoms could I detect
that the mind of the great leader was taxed by the
infinite cares of a terribly hazardous military <span class='it'>coup de
main</span>. Apparently it did not lay upon his mind the
weight of a feather. A mail arrived. He tore open the
papers and glanced over them hastily, then chatted with
some general officers near him, then rode off with characteristic
suddenness, but with fresh and smiling countenance,
filing down the road beside many thousand men,
whose lives were in his keeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truly great mind is magnanimous in the hour of
victory; a selfish, narrow one is arrogant and oppressive.
We ought to be devoutly grateful to God for leaders in
this second life-struggle of freedom, who in general character
emulate our unrivalled Washington, and do not tarnish

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/d.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='D'/>URING the truce which closed September 22d,
General Hood had moved his army toward Macon,
to protect that important town. But the
startling rumor reached his ear that his bold
antagonist would turn his front toward Mobile,
away on the shores of the Gulf. This drew the rebel
chief from his position, and brought him by a westward
movement across the track toward the seaboard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Sunday, September 25th, at Macon, Jeff Davis
addressed the soldiers, assuring them their feet would
soon press the soil of Tennessee, spreading before them
golden visions of conquest and abundance of supplies.
To compel General Sherman to abandon his southern
march, and follow him into Tennessee, the desperate
leader of treason’s battalions wheeled about and recrossed
the Chattahoochie River. Thus was abandoned
the great State of Georgia, and the “hotbed of secession,”
South Carolina, to the Union army. Generals
Hood and Forrest began to cut railroad lines and burn
bridges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Allatoona Pass the enemy made a furious assault
on our garrison to regain this Thermopylæ of the campaign,
but dashed in vain upon the valor of our unyielding
ranks. The commander-in-chief of our forces, who
had signalled General Corse from the top of Kenesaw
Mountain to meet the enemy there, sent the “boys” his
warm congratulations:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi,</span> }</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>In the Field, Kenesaw Mountain</span>, <span class='it'>Oct. 7, 1864</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The General commanding avails himself of the
opportunity, in the handsome defence made of ‘Alatoona,’
to illustrate the most important principle in war, that fortified
posts should be defended to the last, regardless of
the relative numbers of the party attacking and attacked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allatoona was garrisoned by three regiments, commanded
by Colonel Tourtelotte, and reënforced by a detachment
from a division at Rome, under command of
Brigadier-General J. M. Corse, on the morning of the
5th, and a few hours after was attacked by French’s
division of Stewart’s corps, two other divisions being
near at hand, and in support. General French demanded
a surrender, in a letter, to ‘avoid a useless effusion of
blood,’ and gave but five minutes for answer. General
Corse’s answer was emphatic and strong, that he
and his command were ready for the ‘useless effusion of
blood’ as soon as it was agreeable to General French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This was followed by an attack which was prolonged
for five hours, resulting in the complete repulse of
the enemy, who left his dead on the ground, amounting
to more than two hundred, and four hundred prisoners,
well and wounded. The ‘effusion of blood’ was not
‘useless,’ as the position at Allatoona was and is very
important to our present and future operations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The thanks of this army are due, and are hereby
accorded, to General Corse, Colonel Tourtelotte, officers
and men, for their determined and gallant defence of
Allatoona, and it is made an example to illustrate the
importance of preparing in time, and meeting the danger,
when present, boldly, manfully, and well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The army, though unseen to the garrison, was cöoperating
by moving toward the road by which the enemy
could alone escape, but unfortunately were delayed
by the rain and mud; but this fact hastened the retreat
of the enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Commanders and garrisons of the posts along our
railroads are hereby instructed that they must hold their
posts to the last minute, sure that the time gained is
valuable and necessary to their comrades at the front.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>While General Hood was thus retracing his steps,
capturing Dalton and threatening Chattanooga, General
Sherman was on his track, pursuing him to the Tennessee.
The lion-hearted Thomas was at Nashville, and,
quite sure that he could “take care of Hood,” as the order
ran, the great commander turned his face again southward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had telegraphed to the Secretary of War that his
army needed rest at Atlanta. It was true, but General
Sherman did not intend to have it then. The rebels and
the country were bewildered by his mysterious movements.
Early in November he was between the Tennessee
and Chattahoochie, his headquarters at Kingston,
with Rome on the line to Atlanta. The deeply-laid game
was played by the master hand in the dark to others.
Preparations were at once made for a grander campaign
than that which had just closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 10th, when the evening darkened around the
beautiful Rome of Georgia, the heavens glowed with its
conflagration. A fearful storm had ceased, the advance
was at hand, and it was necessary, in the stern demands
of war, to make a torch and desolation of that place,
in the wake of the march. The fire was kindled by
General Corse, according to the orders of the commander.
A spectator wrote of the scenes of that terrific conflagration:</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/savannah-illo.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0006' style='width:500px;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span style='font-size:smaller'>MARCHING TO SAVANNAH.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>“All the barracks were laid in ashes, and a black veil
of dense smoke hung over the war-desolated city nearly
all day, arising from the smouldering ruins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Owing to the great lack of railroad transportation,
General Corse was obliged to destroy nearly a million of
dollars’ worth of property, among which was a few thousand
dollars’ worth of condemned and unserviceable government
stores. Nine rebel guns, captured at Rome by
our troops, were burst, it being deemed unsafe to use them.
One thousand bales of fine cotton, two flour mills, two rolling
mills, two tanneries, one salt mill, an extensive foundry,
several machine shops, together with the railroad depots
and storehouses, four pontoon bridges, built by General
Corse’s pioneer corps for use on the Coosa and Etowah
rivers, and a substantial trestle bridge, nearly completed
for use, were destroyed. This trestle, constructed by the
Engineer corps, I am told, would have cost fifty thousand
dollars North. Recollecting the outrages perpetrated
upon Colonel Streight by the ‘Romans,’ our troops, as
soon as they learned that the town was to be abandoned
and a portion of it burned, resolved to lay Rome in ashes
in revenge. The roaring of the flames, as they leaped
from window to window, their savage tongues of fire
darting high up into the heavens, and then licking the
sides of the buildings, presented an awful but grand
spectacle, while the mounted patrol and the infantrymen
glided along through the brilliant light like the ghostly
spectres of horrid war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concentrating at Atlanta, the last use made of the
stronghold and cherished hope of the Confederacy was
the finishing work of getting a vast army in motion—a
grand start into hostile country, away from the base of
supplies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the men had bivouacked for the night, the following
orders, issued by General Sherman, were read to
the troops, and were greeted with many manifestations
of approbation by the veterans, who, in so many bloody
battles, have followed the lead of Sherman:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Headquarters, Military Division of the Mississippi,</span> }</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>In the Field, Kingston, Ga.</span>, <span class='it'>Nov. 8, 1864</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The General commanding deems it proper at this
time to inform the officers and men of the Fourteenth,
Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Twentieth Corps, that he has
organized them into an army for a special purpose well
known to the War Department and to General Grant. It
is sufficient for you to know that it involves a departure
from our present base, and a long and difficult march to
a new one. All the chances of war have been considered
and provided for as far as human sagacity can. All he
asks of you is to maintain that discipline, patience and
courage which have characterized you in the past, and
he hopes, through you, to strike a blow at our enemy that
will have a material effect in producing what we all so
much desire, his complete overthrow. Of all things the
most important is, that the men, during marches and in
camp, keep their places, and not scatter about as stragglers
or foragers, to be picked up by hostile people in detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is also of the utmost importance that our wagons
should not be loaded with anything but provisions and
ammunition. All surplus servants, non-combatants, and
refugees should now go to the rear, and none should be
encouraged to encumber us on the march. At some
future time we will be enabled to provide for the poor
whites and blacks who seek to escape the bondage under
which they are now suffering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With these few simple cautions in your minds, he
hopes to lead you to achievements equal in importance to
those of the past.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;'>“By order of</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“Major-General <span class='sc'>W. T. Sherman</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>The grand army, of more than fifty thousand men, was
divided into two wings, although in some of its movements
arranged in three or more separate columns.
General Slocum commanded the left wing, composed of
the Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps, and General Howard
the right wing, made up of the Fifteenth and Seventeenth
Corps. The dashing, brilliant Kilpatrick was
chief of a cavalry force. The marching orders were issued,
and flew along the extended battle front, meeting
with a glad welcome from the troops. The clear directions
of the chieftain will present the line and method of march:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>In the Field, Kingston, Ga.</span>, <span class='it'>November 9, 1864</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I. For the purpose of military operations, this army
is divided into two wings, viz.: The right wing, Major-General
O. O. Howard, commanding the Fifteenth and
Seventeenth Corps; the left wing, Major-General H. W.
Slocum, commanding the Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“II. The habitual order of march will be, whenever
practicable, by four roads, as nearly parallel as possible,
and converging at points hereafter to be indicated in
orders. The cavalry, Brigadier-General Kilpatrick commanding,
will receive special orders from the Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“III. There will be no general trains of supplies, but
each corps will have its ammunition and provision train,
distributed habitually as follows: Behind each regiment
should follow one wagon and one ambulance; behind each
brigade should follow a due proportion of ammunition
wagons, provision wagons, and ambulances. In case of
danger, each army corps should change this order of
march by having his advance and rear brigade unencumbered
by wheels. The separate columns will start
habitually at seven <span class='sc'>a. m.</span>, and make about fifteen miles
per day, unless otherwise fixed in orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“IV. The army will <span class='it'>forage liberally on the country</span>
during the march. To this end each brigade commander
will organize a good and sufficient foraging party, under
the command of one or more discreet officers, who will
gather, near the route travelled, corn or forage of any
kind, meat of any kind, vegetables, corn-meal, or whatever
is needed by the command; aiming at all times to
keep in the wagon trains <span class='it'>at least ten days’ provisions for
the command and three days’ forage. Soldiers must not
enter the dwellings</span> of the inhabitants or commit any trespass;
during the halt or a camp they may be permitted to
gather turnips, potatoes, and other vegetables, and drive
in stock in front of their camps. To regular foraging
parties must be intrusted the gathering of provisions and
forage at any distance from the road travelled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“V. To army corps commanders is intrusted the power
<span class='it'>to destroy mills, houses, cotton-gins, etc.</span>, and for them this
general principle is laid down: In districts and neighborhoods
<span class='it'>where the army is unmolested, no destruction</span> of such
property should be permitted; but should guerillas or
bushwhackers molest our march, or should the inhabitants
burn bridges, obstruct roads, or otherwise manifest local
hostility, then army corps commanders should order and
<span class='it'>enforce a devastation more or less relentless, according to
the measure of such hostility</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“VI. As for horses, mules, wagons, etc., belonging
to the inhabitants, the cavalry and artillery may appropriate
freely and without limit; discriminating, however,
between the rich, who are usually hostile, and the poor
or industrious, usually neutral or friendly. Foraging
parties may also take mules or horses to replace the jaded
animals of their trains, or to serve as pack mules for the
regiments or brigades. In all foraging, of whatever kind,
the parties engaged will refrain from abusive or threatening
language, and may, when the officer in command
thinks proper, give written certificates of the facts, but
no receipts; and they will endeavor to leave with each
family a reasonable portion for their maintenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“VII. <span class='it'>Negroes who are able-bodied and can be of service
to the several columns, may be taken along</span>; but each
army commander will bear in mind that the question of
supplies is a very important one, and that his first duty is
to see to those who bear arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“VIII. The organization at once of a good pioneer
battalion for each corps, composed, if possible, of negroes,
should be attended to. This battalion should follow the
advance guard, should repair roads and double them if
possible, so that the columns will not be delayed after
reaching bad places. Also, army commanders should
study the habit of giving the artillery and wagons the
road, and marching their troops on one side; and also
instruct their troops to assist wagons at steep hills or bad
crossings or streams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“IX. Captain O. M. Poe, chief engineer, will assign
to each wing of the army a pontoon train, fully equipped
and organized, and the commanders thereof will see to
its being properly protected at all times.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“By order of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major-General <span class='sc'>W. T. Sherman</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>The feeling of the troops is expressed in the words
of another who was with them: “They do not stop to
ask questions. Sherman says ‘Come,’ and that is the
entire vocabulary with them. A most cheerful feature
of the situation is the fact that the men are healthful and
jolly as men can be, hoping for the best, daring to do the
worst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behind us we leave a track of smoke and flame.
Half of Marietta was burned up, not by orders, however,
for the command is that proper details shall be
made to destroy all property which can ever be of
use to the rebel armies. Stragglers will get into these
places, and dwelling-houses are levelled to the ground.
In nearly all cases these are the deserted habitations
formerly owned by rebels, who are now refugees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yesterday, as some of the men were marching toward
the Chattahoochie River, they saw in the distance
pillars of smoke rising along its banks; the bridges were
in flames. Says one, hitching his musket a bit on the
shoulder in a free and easy way, ‘I say, Charley, I believe
Sherman has set the river on fire.’ ‘Reckon not,’
replied the other, with the same indifference. ‘If he
has, it’s all right.’ And so they pass along, obeying
orders, not knowing what is before them, but believing in
their leader.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foraging parties were to bring in from the country
along the war-path, supplies for the long cavalcade,
sweeping over a belt of land twenty to seventy miles
wide, right across the proud State of Georgia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The regulations respecting retaliation for outrages
were wise and humane, because they prevented the very
ruin which the rebels, unrestrained by fear, would have
drawn upon themselves. It was not an idle threat, but
proved to be a most timely, useful one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>November 12th, you might have seen the magnificent
spectacle a great war alone affords. Mounted on his
steed, his cork hand on the rein, General Howard led the
right wing in bristling ranks, to the sound of martial airs,
from Atlanta. And here I must tell you about that cork
hand. You may recollect that the heroic chief lost his arm
at Fair Oaks, fighting under General McClellan. He returned
soon after to his home in Lewiston, Maine. It
happened that I was there upon a beautiful summer day,
when the Sabbath-school children had a meeting in Rev.
Mr. Adams’s church, at Auburn, across the river. General
Howard was present, the first time he had attended
a public gathering since the wound was received. And
many hearts were touched to hear him talk earnestly of
truth and duty, while the yet unhealed stump would try
to gesticulate, as the arm did of old. He is a complete
man, and appreciated by his general-in-chief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The imposing pageant of the advancing host was repeated
on the 14th, when General Slocum marched at
the head of the left wing from the doomed city. Then General
Sherman, with his staff and body-guard, gave a last
look, and took his road to Macon. “Let Hood go North;
our business is down South,” was his brief comment upon
the rebel general’s movements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The torch was applied to the public buildings and
railroad depots, flinging at night a lurid light over the
dismantled ruined fortifications, and upon the surrounding
hills. The scene was grand and awful, memorable
to all who witnessed this burning of the “Gate City.”
No private residences were designedly given to the
flames. “The evidence of the rebels themselves has
since appeared to show, that though Atlanta had been
besieged, captured, and depopulated, there was no heartless
or unavoidable destruction of private property, such
as the enemy have delighted to charge upon General
Sherman. Thus abandoned, it was left in the rear of
our army, whose face was now seaward, and the hand of
time, with a higher degree of civilization, can only efface
the marks inflicted by a warlike occupation. Before the
war Atlanta was one of the most thriving inland cities of
the South, and contained 12,000 inhabitants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The rebels at Richmond received their first news of
Sherman’s departure from Atlanta, from the North, but
refused to place confidence in it. ‘It is a big Yankee
lie,’ said the Richmond <span class='it'>Examiner</span>, ‘and if Sherman really
has burnt Atlanta, it is to cover a retreat northward,
to look after Hood.’ ‘But if Sherman is really attempting
this prodigious design,’ it continued, ‘his march will
only lead him to the “Paradise of Fools.” ’ The more
Southern papers, those of Augusta, Savannah, etc., were
alike incredulous with those of Richmond, upon the receipt
of the first news of Sherman’s movement. ‘It is
rumored that Atlanta is evacuated,’ said the Augusta
<span class='it'>Chronicle</span>, of November 15, ‘and we trust the rumor
will prove correct.’ The same paper of November 18,
implores the citizens of Augusta to ‘look at the situation
without nervousness or fear—pray to God, but keep your
powder dry—meet the storm like men—it’s always darkest
just before day.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is only necessary to follow Sherman’s course, to
note the precision with which he moved, the width of
country which he covered, and the directness of his
march upon his objective point, to realize the impotency
of all the shrieks, invocations, and proclamations that
only spoiled so much valuable paper in the Confederacy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the heavens hung like curtains of glowing
crimson above and around the circular theatre of ruin,
whose cinders shot through the hot atmosphere continually,
the fine band of the Thirty-third Massachusetts
were playing, “John Brown’s soul goes marching on!”
The effect was awfully grand; the strange stirring anthem
rising over the advance of that mighty host whose
way was flashing with the torchlights of burning buildings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us suppose we were upon an eminence near Atlanta,
with power of vision to look away over the “heart
of Georgia,” the goal of General Sherman’s moving
columns. Running through it are two railroads, the
only lines traversing the State of Georgia, and forming
the chief link of railway connection between Virginia and
the States of Alabama and Mississippi, now the southwestern
limit of the so-called Confederacy. One of these
railroads is the Georgia Central, running from Savannah
to Macon, 190 miles, thence to Atlanta, by the Macon
and Western Railroad, 101 miles, making the total distance
from Savannah to Atlanta by railroad, 291 miles.
The other is the Georgia Railroad, running from Augusta
to Atlanta, at from 40 to 60 miles north of the Georgia
Central Railroad, and making the distance to Atlanta,
from Augusta, 171 miles. At Millen, on the Georgia
Central road, 79 miles north of Savannah, is the junction
of a branch road, called the Waynesboro’ Railroad, which
connects with Augusta, 53 miles distant, and makes the
distance by rail from Savannah to Augusta 132 miles.
Along these lines of travel the country is thickly settled,
and richly productive. Cotton, wheat, and corn fields,
with forests and streams, mansions and slave huts,
make a southern landscape inviting to a great army,
whose thousands of men must have food to eat, and
plenty of it. To cover the railroads and destroy them
as the troops advanced, making Milledgeville, the capital,
a point of rendezvous, was the first object of the commander.
General Kilpatrick’s splendid cavalry protected
flank and front—“the eyes of the army.” On, on, the
extended wings move; while a cavalry force sweeps off
toward Macon, where General Cobb commands the rebel
militia, to make him believe an attack upon him is designed.
The “fire-eater” is awake to his perilous position,
and ready to defend “Southern rights;” when, lo!
the horsemen suddenly disappear. Their enterprise seems
a serious joke, provoking a laugh; for it was to keep at
Macon the only force that could dispute the way, excepting
some cavalry brigades at Macon, till left fairly in the rear.
This being done, General Sherman cared little where the
Confederate hero went. The enemy was amazed and bewildered—the
bold invader’s plans baffled his attempts to
decipher them. An extract from a Richmond paper will
be both a curious and interesting illustration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Sentinel</span> with assurance declared: “It is not Sherman’s
object to make his way to the Atlantic to assist
Meade, leaving Thomas heir to his far higher honors and
responsibilities in the West. If he shall succeed in penetrating
the circle that now surrounds him, and escaping
to Port Royal, his first anxiety, like Kilpatrick’s, will be
for ships to take him away. Steam to Annapolis, and
steam to Nashville, if Nashville be not already fallen, will
be all too slow to quiet his impatience and to mollify his
chagrin. While his own course through Georgia will
have been that of an arrow through the air, or a ship
over the sea, leaving no track behind; while his exploits
and his honors will have been those of the baffled fox
hounded from the barn-yard, or the disappointed wolf,
chased and pelted by the shepherds; he will return to
Tennessee to find Hood, we trust, in possession of the
State. He will return to find that his campaign into
Georgia, so boastfully entered upon, has but lost the territories
won by his predecessors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the editors and other leading minds at the
Confederate capital were thus speculating and wondering,
General Sherman was having a most auspicious start on
the long march over rebel soil. “The right wing moved
directly south from Atlanta, which is in Fulton County,
to Rough and Ready and Jonesboro’ stations on the
Macon and Western Railroad, in Fayette County. On
November 16th one column of the right wing passed
through Jonesboro’, twenty-six miles south of Atlanta,
Wheeler’s cavalry and Cobb’s militia retiring upon Griffin.
Another column of the right wing occupied McDonough,
November 17th, the county seat of Henry County, some
distance east of Jonesboro’, and about thirty-five miles
southeast of Atlanta. Henry County is one of the largest
and richest of Georgia, and here our forces found large
supplies of provisions and forage. On the 16th Wheeler
engaged our cavalry at Bear Creek station, ten miles
north of Griffin, and telegraphed General Hardee that he
had ‘checked the Yankee advance.’ The very same
evening, at six o’clock, his ragged troopers fell back
through Griffin, in the direction of Barnesville, where
Cobb’s militia had already preceded him. Our cavalry
occupied Griffin, which is the county seat of Spalding
County, on the 17th, and on the 18th drove Wheeler out
of Barnesville, in Pike County, and through Forsyth, the
county seat of Monroe County, seventy-six miles south
of Atlanta and twenty-five miles northwest of Macon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning to the map you will see the Ocumulgee
River, on whose banks Macon is situated, northeast of
which, on the Oconee, is Milledgeville, the State capital.
November 20th General Sherman crossed the former
stream with his face toward the seat of government; this
was the first intelligence the rebels had of his purpose to
pass by Macon. Meanwhile General Howard’s columns
moved rapidly through Monticello, the shire town of
Jasper County, burning the courthouse, thence to Hillsboro’,
the county seat of Jones County, to reach the
Georgia Central Railroad at Gordon, where the branch
track to Milledgeville has its junction. Thus General
Sherman left General Cobb behind, and sending to Griswoldville
a rear-guard of infantry, pushed on the 21st
to Milledgeville, with General Howard’s troops ready to
join him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The march, so far, had averaged thirteen and a half
miles each day, making ninety-five miles from Atlanta.
There was no need of great haste, and the strength of the
men was spared for the vast enterprise before them.
“General Sherman camped on the plantation of Howell
Cobb. We found his granaries well filled with corn and
wheat, part of which was distributed and eaten by our
animals and men. A large supply of syrup made from
sorghum, which we have found at nearly every plantation
on our march, was stored in an out-house. This was
also disposed of to the soldiers and the poor decrepit negroes,
which this humane, liberty-loving major-general,
abandoned to die in this place a few days ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Sherman distributed to the negroes with
his own hands the provisions left here, and assured them
that we were their friends, and they need not be afraid
that we were foes. One old man answered him: ‘I
spose dat you’se true; but, massa, you’se’ll go way tomorrow,
and anudder white man will come.’ He had
never known any thing but oppression, and had been
kept in such ignorance that he did not dare put faith in
any white man. The negroes were told that as soon
as we got them into our power, they were put into the
front of the battle, and we killed them if they did not
fight; that we threw the women and children into the
Chattahoochie, and when the buildings were burned in
Atlanta, we filled them with negroes, to be devoured by
the flames.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Sherman invited all able-bodied negroes
(others could not make the march) to join the
column, and he takes especial pleasure when they join
the procession, on some occasions telling them they are
free: that Massa Lincoln has given them their liberty,
and that they can go where they please; that if they earn
their freedom they should have it, but that Massa Lincoln
had given it to them anyhow. Thousands of negro
women join the column, some carrying household truck;
others, and many of them there are, who bear the heavy
burdens of children in their arms, while older boys and
girls plod by their sides. All these women and children
are ordered back, heartrending though it may be to refuse
them liberty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But the majority accept the advent of the Yankees
as the fulfilment of the millennial prophecies. The ‘day
of jubilee,’ the hope and prayer of a lifetime, has come.
They cannot be made to understand that they must remain
behind, and they are satisfied only when General
Sherman tells them, as he does every day, that we
shall come back for them some time, and that they
must be patient until the proper hour of deliverance
comes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The enemy finding our army had deceived them and
was gone, General Cobb sent a force from Macon to attack
the rear-guard at Griswoldsville, a part of which had been
employed to threaten Macon, where a sharp skirmish
resulted in a loss to them of several hundred killed and
wounded; the severest battle of all the march. General
Slocum’s left wing had pressed on through De Kalb
County to Covington, burning railroad buildings on the
way. Near this town, while foraging in the fine fertile
country, a force from one of the brigades of the Twentieth
Corps was assailed by a party of “bushwhackers,” and
one of our soldiers killed. Then followed the execution
of General Sherman’s threat of devastation, involving in
it the burning of the Methodist College at Oxford. The
large libraries, the cabinets and apparatus, all were swept
away by the fires of war, the charred ruins of an institution
which cost nearly a million of dollars, only remaining
in the wake of relentless Mars. General Slocum
pushed forward his troops, living on the “fat of the
land,” destroying railways, and flinging on his path the
flames of burning warehouses, markets, and bridges. The
same day that General Howard reached Gordon, General
Slocum was at Eatonton, the northern terminus of the
branch railroad. The troops came together at Milledgeville,
General Howard entering it first with his troops;
because the far-seeing commander-in-chief found that the
best point for crossing the Oconee was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The legislature, which was in session on the 18th,
hearing of the advance of General Sherman’s resistless
columns, prepared to flee before them. Governor Brown
departed in his private carriage for Macon, taking with
him the public papers, funds, and whatever of personal
effects he could convey. Never was such a stampede of
the law-making chivalry of Georgia dreamed of by them.
Members of this terrified body hurried away to Augusta,
and others followed the Governor to Macon; some in carriages,
some on horses, and others on foot, not having
Confederate currency enough to pay for other means of
escape. Two of the honorable fugitives paid one thousand
dollars to be carried eight miles. Scarcely had
Governor Brown reached Macon when he hastened to
the City Hall and issued a flaming proclamation—chanticleer
crowing after he is driven from the field by his
rival in the fight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Catching the contagious alarm, in the wake of the fugitive
legislature, the citizens able to get away, carrying with
them to the depot their household treasures, then also fled,
until the infirm and the negroes only represented the just
now proud and defiant population. The latter were wild
with joy, embracing the soldiers, and exclaiming, “Bless
de Lord! tanks be to Almighty God, the Yanks is come;
the day of jubilee hab arrived!” Such was their simple
recognition of God in the war, and of the friends of liberty.
General Sherman’s headquarters were at the Executive
Mansion, its former occupant having, with extremely bad
grace, in fleeing from his distinguished visitor, taken with
him the entire furniture of the building. As General Sherman
travels with a roll of blankets, and haversack full of
hard tack, which is as complete an outfit for a life out in
the open air as in a palace, this discourtesy of Governor
Brown was not a serious inconvenience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The campaign toward the sea was now fairly opened,
and successful in all its details: “At first, moving his
army in three columns, with a column of cavalry on his
extreme right, upon eccentric lines, he diverted the attention
of the enemy, so that he concentrated his forces at
extreme points, Macon and Augusta, leaving unimpeded
the progress of the main body. In this campaign it was
not the purpose of the General to spend his time before fortified
cities, nor yet to encumber his wagons with wounded
men. His instructions to Kilpatrick were to demonstrate
against Macon, getting within five miles of the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With that ignorance of danger common to new
troops, the rebels rushed upon our veterans with the
greatest fury. They were received with grape-shot and
musketry at point blank range, our soldiers firing coolly
while shouting derisively to the quivering columns to
come on, as if they thought the whole thing a nice joke.
The rebels resumed the attack, but with the same fatal
results, and were soon in full flight, leaving more than
three hundred dead on the field. Our loss was some
forty killed and wounded, while their killed, wounded,
and prisoners, are estimated to exceed two thousand five
hundred. A pretty severe lesson they received. It
is said, ‘<span class='it'>Ce n’est que le premier pas qui coûte.</span>’ This first
step has been a most expensive one, and judging from the
fact that we have not heard from them since, they seem
to have interpreted the proverb otherwise than in the recognized
sense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gov. Brown reluctantly left in Milledgeville three thousand
muskets and several thousand pounds of powder, to
be destroyed by our troops. Then came a comic episode
in the march. A number of officers and men took possession
of the State House, elected a speaker, a clerk, and
a chaplain, and went to work upon bills and resolutions in
earnest. Calls to order, deciding between members claiming
the floor, and humorous hits, filled up the time.
When in the midst of the amusing excitement, a courier
rushed in, saying, the “Yankees are coming!” then there
was a sudden suspension of business, a panic, and a run
for the doors. This was succeeded by an uproar of
laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somehow the entreaty of the politicians and editors
of the Confederacy to burn and otherwise destroy
property likely to fall into our hands, did not move the
hearts of traitors. Each waited to see his neighbor commence
the havoc, and excepting what the army appropriated,
and the rebels carried off, but little damage was
done. The enemy was completely in the mist of mystery,
and General Sherman’s skilful, blinding movements,
successfully deluded his antagonists. Their
blows were always hesitating, and, when given by them,
were equally ineffectual. It was evident, however, that
the Oconee River must be passed at some point by our
troops. Accordingly, the enemy posted himself where
the railroad crosses the river, five miles east of Gordon,
and here burned the bridge. Wednesday, the 23d,
brought our troops well up to the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The people along the line of march seldom expressed
their sentiments to the army. A few illustrations from
those who saw and heard for themselves, will give the
general feeling: “When they do speak it is not in vain
eulogy of the rebel army and the cause in which they are
engaged. They are broken in spirits, and the haughty
secession ladies, who by force of ‘arms’ and tongue drove
their brothers, sons, and lovers, into the army, are now
as meek as singed kittens, and only too glad to smile upon
a good-looking Yankee. They all frankly admit that
their cause is hopeless—that subjugation awaits them in
the future, and all they now wish is for the storm to
burst and pass; that peace with them, crushed beneath
the Yankee heel, is preferable to the present state of
things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Great God!’ exclaimed one very intelligent Milledgeville
lady, whose all had been taken, ‘little did I
think, when I bade my dear boys, who now sleep in their
graves, good-bye, and packed them off, that this day would
come, when old, impoverished, and childless, I must ask
the men whom they fought against for a meal of victuals
to satisfy my hunger. But it serves me right; I was deceived,
drove them to battle, death, and infamy, and here
I stand, their murderer.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Riding up to a house one day, I met an old woman
and three grown-up daughters at the door uttering frantic
appeals for help. I inquired what was wrong, when the
old woman pointed to a burning cotton gin, and exclaimed,
‘Put it out! You uns are burnin’ me child!’ I asked
where the child was, and succeeded in learning that it
was in the burning gin house. Away I went, with some
men, to rescue the innocent, and at the door met a ten
year old boy, who, badly singed, issued forth from the
fiery furnace. Returning to the house, I inquired how
the boy came there? Putting the pipe between her lips,
to compose her nerves, the old lady at last ventured an
explanation: ‘Well,’ said she, ‘we uns heard that you
uns killed all the little boys, to keep them out from growing
up to fight ye, and we hid ’em.’ Strange as this may
seem, among the poor, ignorant dupes of Davis, it is a
common belief that the Yankees slay all the male children.
We found many infant Moseses and Jeffs hid away
in cellars and corn-cribs, but none in bulrushes. An officer
called upon a lady in Effingham County, whose plantation
had been stripped of every thing, and found her in
tears and her children crying for bread. He endeavored
to soothe her, when she lifted up her beautiful eyes beseechingly,
and implored, ‘Give me something for my
starving children.’ Away the officer went to his mess
and fed the children from his private larder. On the following
morning he was quite chagrined to witness two
oak boxes, one barrel of flour, four trunks, and other articles
exhumed from the garden by the soldiers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eight days’ march to Millen, seventy-five miles
from Milledgeville, was full of varied and remarkable
interest. General Kilpatrick, with his “ubiquitous
cavalry,” galloped away to the Central Railroad bridge,
over the Oconee, twenty-five miles southeast of Milledgeville,
where General Howard was trying to build a
pontoon bridge, which the rebel General Wayne, with a
brigade of released inmates of the penitentiary, and of
militia, was determined to prevent; a battle followed, and
the enemy was driven back. Then again the unrivalled
trooper acted as “a curtain” upon the extreme left, having
covered in the same way the right wing in the earlier
part of the campaign; while all the time he had the
nobler aim, if possible, to reach Millen in time to rescue
our incarcerated and dying prisoners of war. “The
stockade or coop in which our prisoners were confined,
after their removal from Andersonville, was located in a
dense pine forest, six miles from Millen station, on the
Savannah and Augusta Railroad. It was a square of fifteen
acres, enclosed by pine logs set upright in the ground,
very close together. At intervals of twenty feet along
the palisades were the sentry boxes, fifteen feet from the
ground; access to them could only be had by means
of ladders on the outside. The palisade logs were uniformly
ten inches thick, and so straight and close were
they that all view of the pine woods beyond them was
shut out from the unfortunates within. Entering at the
broad gate they crossed the ‘dead line’ (single rail fence)
fearlessly, and approached the burrows or adobe huts
where the ‘Yankees’ had slept in confinement. These
were not filthy, because no considerable amount of filth
could accumulate during the three weeks our men were
kept there; but they were cheerless and comfortless.
There was no attempt at regularity in laying out this village
of Kennel. In one of them the dead body of a Union
soldier, name unknown, was found unburied. Decidedly
the most comfortable looking appendage to the stockade
was the brick cook-house near the centre, with accommodation
for a dozen or fifteen men to work at a time. At
the southeast angle of the stockade, on the outside, stood
a square earthwork, built to command with its guns both
the burrows inside and the approaches to the logs on the
outside. In the hospital huts, a quarter of a mile from
the pen, were good accommodations for three hundred
men, and there were evidences that they were not sufficient.
A fine large spring, where excellent water bubbled
out, completed the lists of objects familiar to the brave
boys who had lived in that silent clearing in the pine
woods. The dead prisoners were buried in rows, a short
distance from the hospital, graves being numbered as high
as six hundred and fifty. The prisoners were kept at
Millen only three weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>November 29th the “boys” kept Thanksgiving upon
the luxuries of Georgia plantations. The Ogeehee was
crossed on November 30th. It is a stream sixty yards
wide, where the troops passed over on a bridge which
was put in repair, and with pontoons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a sketch from a reliable source, we have an explanation
of the false charge made by a distinguished orator
against General Sherman, that he removed a bridge, and
left unprotected negroes to the enemy. He knew nothing
of the sad affair when it occurred:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From the time we left Atlanta, with fifty or one
hundred contrabands, the ‘colored brigades’ continued to
swell in numbers until we arrived at the Ogeechee River,
when fully ten thousand were attached to the various
columns. They represented all shades and conditions,
from the almost white housemaid servant, worth $15,000
in rebel currency, to the tar black, pock-marked cotton
picker, who never crosses massa’s door sill. A very large
majority of them were women and children, who, mounted
on mules, sometimes five on an animal, in ox wagons,
buggies, and vehicles of every description, blocked the
roads and materially delayed the movement of the columns.
It was no unusual sight to behold a slave mother carrying
two young children and leading a third, who, in a half
nude state, trudged along the thorny path to freedom.
Columns could be written descriptive of the harrowing
scenes presented by this unfortunate class of fugitives. So
much difficulty did General Davis find in moving his
column, that at the Ogeechee River, as a military necessity,
he placed a guard at the bridge, who halted the
caravan of contrabands until the rear of the column
passed, and then removed the pontoon. The negroes,
however, not to be frustrated, constructed a foot-bridge
and crossed. Next day the column had its full complement
of negroes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Arriving at Ebenezer Creek, the same method was
taken to clear the column, with better success. The
creek runs through a half mile of swamp, which is covered
by water, and can only be crossed by a narrow bridge.
This bridge was taken up, and the moment our forces disappeared
the brutal Wheeler was in our rear. Next day
only a few darkies came up. Another day passed and
still fully two-thirds were missing. Inquiries elicited the
information that Wheeler, on finding the defenceless negroes
blocked, drove them pellmell into the water, where
those who escaped say they struggled to reach the opposite
bank, amidst heartrending shrieks; but most of the
mothers went down in the water with their children
clasped to their bosoms, while Wheeler and his inhuman
band looked on with demoniac smiles. How far true this
may be I know not, but all the negroes who escaped, with
whom I have talked, seem to agree in their account of the
hellish slaughter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bridges over the Oconee and Fisher’s Creek
were burned behind the army. The rebels were compelled
to speak well, on the whole, of General Sherman’s
command. I shall add their testimony, given at the
time:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In their route they destroyed, as far as possible, all
mills, cribs, and gin-houses, cotton screws and gins, cotton
implements, etc., and carried off all stock, provisions,
and negroes. When their horses gave out they shot
them. At Eatonton they killed over one hundred. At
Milledgeville they only destroyed the arsenal, depot, and
penitentiary. They did not burn the factory near that
place. The right wing of the Federal army, under
General Howard, crossed the Ocmulgee River between
Adams’s Ferry and Macon. It is said that the town of
Forsyth was completely demolished. The Federals expressed
great astonishment at the rich country they were
passing, and the abundance of provisions in it. General
Slocum gave orders to the citizens along his route to
shoot down his stragglers without mercy. One punishment
inflicted by some of the Federal generals for plundering,
was severe whipping. A portion of Major Graham’s
command reached this city last night. They report
that they visited Atlanta several days since, and
found it completely evacuated and burned. They state
that the Federals took all the cattle and forage in their
route, but did not molest those who stayed at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most pathetic scenes occur upon our line of
march daily and hourly. Thousands of negro women
join the column, some carrying household truck; others,
and many of them there are, who bear the burden of
children in their arms, while older boys and girls plod by
their sides. All these women and children are ordered
back, heartrending though it may be to refuse them liberty.
They won’t go. One begs that she may go to see
her husband and children at Savannah. Long years ago
she was forced from them and sold. Another has heard
that her boy was in Macon, and she is ‘done gone with
grief goin’ on four years.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The other day a woman with a child in her arms
was working her way along amongst the teams and
crowds of cattle and horsemen. An officer called to her
kindly: ‘Where are you going, aunty?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She looked up into his face with a hopeful, beseeching
look, and replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’se gwine whar you’se gwine, massa.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At a house a few miles from Milledgeville we
halted for an hour. In an old hut I found a negro and
his wife, both of them over sixty years old. In the talk
which ensued nothing was said which led me to suppose
that either of them was anxious to leave their mistress,
who, by the way, was a sullen, cruel-looking woman,
when all at once the old negress straightened herself up,
and her face, which a moment before was almost stupid
in its expression, assumed a fierce, almost devilish, aspect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pointing her shining black finger at the old man,
crouched in the corner of the fire-place, she hissed out:
‘What for you sit dar? you spose I wait sixty years for
nutten? Don’t yer see de door open? I’se follow my
child; I not stay. Yes, nodder day I goes ’long wid
dese people; yes sar, I walks till I drops in my tracks.’
A more terrible sight I never beheld. I can think of
nothing to compare with it, except Charlotte Cushman’s
Meg Merrilies. Rembrandt only could have painted the
scene, with its dramatic surroundings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was near this place that several factories were
burned. It was odd to see the delight of the negroes at
the destruction of places known only to them as task-houses,
where they had groaned under the lash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pointing to the Atlanta and Augusta Railroad,
which had been destroyed, the question was asked, ‘It
took a longer time to build this railroad than it does to
destroy it?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I would think it did, massa; in dat ar woods over
dar is buried ever so many black men who were killed,
sar, yes, killed, a working on dat road—whipped to deth.
I seed em, sar.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Does the man live here who beat them?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Oh no, sar; he’s dun gone long time.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have seen blind and lame mules festooned with
infants in bags, and led by fond parents so aged and
weak they could hardly totter along. ‘Mars’r Sherman
was a great man, but dis am de work ob de Lord,’ they said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The swampy borders were belted with “corduroy,”
and their heavy fogs hung over the halting columns. At
evening the spectacle was weird-like in its wild romance.
“A novel and vivid sight was it to see the fires of
pitch pine flaring up into the mist and darkness, the figures
of men and horses looming out of the dense shadows
in gigantic proportions. Torchlights are blinking and
flashing away off in the forests, while the still air echoed
and reëchoed with the cries of teamsters and the wild
shouts of the soldiers. A long line of the troops marched
across the foot-bridge, each soldier bearing a torch, their
light reflected in quivering lines in the swift running
stream. Soon the fog, which settles like a blanket over
the swamps and forests of the river bottoms, shut down
upon the scene, and so dense and dark was it that
torches were of but little use, and men were directed here
and there by the voice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not far from this spot the troops encountered a singular
character. He had been depot-master before the
railroad was destroyed—a shrewd, intelligent old man,
so far as the war is concerned. He said to the soldiers:
“They say you are retreating, but it is the strangest
sort of retreat I ever saw. Why, the newspapers have
been lying in this way all along. They allers are whipping
the Federal armies, and they allers fall back after
the battle is over. It was that ar’ idee that first opened
my eyes. Our army was allers whipping the Feds, and
we allers fell back. I allers told ’em it was a humbug,
and now by —— I know it, for here you are right on
old John Wells’s place; hogs, potatoes, corn, and fences
all gone. I don’t find any fault. I expected it all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Jeff. Davis and the rest,’ he continued, ‘talk about
splitting the Union. Why if South Carolina had gone
out by herself, she would have been split in four pieces
by this time. Splitting the Union! Why, the State of
Georgia is being split right through from end to end. It
is these rich fellows who are making the war, and keeping
their precious bodies out of harm’s way. There’s
John Franklin went through here the other day running
away from your army. I could have played dominoes
on his coat tails. There’s my poor brother, sick with
small-pox at Macon, working for eleven dollars a month,
and hasn’t got a cent of the stuff for a year. Eleven
dollars a month and eleven thousand bullets a minute. I
don’t believe in it, sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘My wife came from Canada, and I kind o’ thought
I would some time go there to live, but was allers afraid
of the ice and cold; but I can tell you this country is
getting too hot for me. Look at my fence-rails burning
there. I think I can stand the cold better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I heard as how they cut down the trees across your
road up country and burn the bridges; why, one of your
Yankees can take up a tree and carry it off, tops and all;
and there’s that bridge you put across the river in less
than two hours—they might as well try to stop the Ogeechee
as you Yankees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘The rascals who burnt this yere bridge thought
they did a big thing; a natural born fool would have
more sense than any of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘To bring back the good old time,’ he said, ‘it’ll
take the help of Divine Providence, a heap of rain, and a
deal of hard work, to fix things up again.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is interesting to look over the sea and get a glimpse
of the impressions of our English <span class='it'>friends</span> regarding the
“wandering host.” The organ of the army and navy
said: “It is clear that, so long as he roams about with
his army inside the Confederate States, he is more deadly
than twenty Grants, and that <span class='it'>he must be destroyed if
Richmond or any thing is to be saved</span>. Lee will probably
be forced by this condition of affairs to assume the offensive,
because he cannot afford to let Grant hold his hands
whilst Sherman is committing burglary in the Southern
mansion. If Sherman has really left his army in the air,
and started off without a base to march from Georgia
into South Carolina, he has done either one of the most
brilliant or one of the most foolish things ever performed
by a military leader.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great leader and his intelligent troops must have
enjoyed the mystery in which both friends and foes were
living; knowing well that in public and private circles,
in the periodical press and the national councils, the speculations
and theories about him, the fears and hopes,
were manifold and often ludicrous, while his battalions
were having a triumphal march over the proudest
portion of the Confederacy. “The great army, over the
lands and into the dwellings of the poor and rich alike,
through towns and cities, like a roaring wave, swept, and
paused, revelled and surged on. In the day-time, the
splendor, the toil, the desolation of the march; in the
night-time, the brilliance, the gloom, the music, the joy
and the slumber of the camp. Memorable the music
‘that mocked the moon’ of November of the soil of
Georgia; sometimes a triumphant march, sometimes a
glorious waltz, again an old air stirring the heart alike to
recollection and to hope. Floating out from throats of
brass to the ears of soldiers in their blankets and generals
within their tents, these tunes hallowed the eves
to all who listened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sitting before his tent in the glow of a camp fire
one evening, General Sherman let his cigar go out to
listen to an air that a distant band was playing. The
musicians ceased at last. The general turned to one of
his officers; ‘Send an orderly to ask that band to play
that tune again.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A little while, and the band received the word.
The tune was ‘The Blue Juniata,’ with exquisite variations.
The band played it again, even more beautifully
than before. Again it ceased, and then, off to the right,
nearly a quarter of a mile away, the voices of some soldiers
took it up with words. The band, and still another
band, played a low accompaniment; camp after camp
began singing; the music of ‘The Blue Juniata’ became,
for a few minutes, the oratorio of half an army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back along the whole wide pathway of this grand
march from border to coast, the eye catches glimpses of
scenes whose savage and poetic images an American,
five years ago, would have thought never could have
been revived from the romantic past.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>History records no war scenes so full of poetic interest,
with so little bloodshed, as those along the path
of this advancing host.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/g.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='G'/>ENERAL HOWARD’S column moved down the
east side of the Oconee River, reaching Sandersville
November 26, burning the depot and tearing
up the railroad near that place. General
Slocum’s battalions of the right wing marched
northward toward Sparta, the cavalry scouring the country,
getting all the forage they needed, horses and mules,
and making havoc with the railroads, mills, and <span class='it'>gin-houses</span>.
These horsemen galloped about as if quite at
home; more like troops at a “general muster” than warriors
at work, excepting the signals of ruin they left behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this very time, November 25, the secessionists
lurking among us at the North, matured a plot for burning
the city of New York, by firing the principal hotels.
Combustibles were placed in rooms which had been mysteriously
engaged, the match applied, and then the doors
locked. But while a dozen hotels or more were thus set
on fire, a watchful Providence led to timely discovery.
Indeed, he confused the conspirators, so that the plot
was poorly executed; the very effort to conceal and give
time for the flames to spread, by leaving the apartments
closed, excluding the currents of air, defeated the fiendish
design.</p>

<p class='pindent'>December 1st, the Fourteenth Corps threatened Augusta:
“The rebels became greatly frightened. Up to
that time many of them were consoled with the idea that,
after all, Sherman was only on a great raid into the
heart of the State, or would yet turn and move westward
upon Columbus, Montgomery, and Mobile. But
such hopes were dispelled when his cavalry were discovered
in Washington and Hancock counties. At Augusta
preparations for defence went on vigorously. Bragg
was summoned from Wilmington, and came, the Augusta
papers said, with ten thousand men. Troops came
from Charleston, Hampton’s cavalry came from Virginia,
and the entire population of the city was put under
arms, and all the slaves in the surrounding country were
impressed to work upon the fortifications. Then began,
also, a vigorous system of rebel <span class='it'>brag</span>. Wheeler was put
to his trumps, and required to whip Kilpatrick three
times a day, and to invariably close the report of his
victory with the announcement, ‘after this glorious success
we fell back!’ All this Wheeler most valiantly did;
but on one occasion, in a fight near Gibson, the county
seat of Glascock County, being required to bring in Kilpatrick’s
head as a trophy, he humbly apologized with
his hat, observing, that in his haste to fall back, he had
left Kilpatrick’s head on its shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until it was fully ascertained that Sherman had
reached Millen, the rebels believed that he was passing
down between the Ogeechee and Oconee Rivers, aiming to
reach the coast at Darien or Brunswick. Very adroit
strategy was necessary at this juncture to conceal the real
direction of the march, for had the rebels known in time
that Augusta was certainly to be avoided, the entire force
there could have been sent down to Millen, and thus
thrown in Sherman’s front, and resisted or delayed his
march upon Savannah, and in the end would have proved
a formidable addition to the garrison of that place. Kilpatrick,
therefore, pressed Wheeler more vigorously than
ever, and the latter fell back toward Augusta, which put
him out of Sherman’s way most effectually, again leaving
him in the rear of the very army whose advance he was
endeavoring to resist. It was during these cavalry operations
that the fight took place at Waynesboro’, December
3d, where Wheeler attacked Kilpatrick, and reported that
he had ‘doubled him up on the main body.’ But Kilpatrick
wouldn’t stay ‘doubled up.’ On the next day
Wheeler was compelled to make his usual report that he
had ‘signally repulsed Kilpatrick’ but was ‘obliged to
<span class='it'>fall back</span>,’ the result of which was that he was driven
back through Waynesboro’ and beyond Brier Creek, the
railway bridge over which was destroyed, within twenty
miles of Augusta, which was the nearest approach of our
forces to that city. Kilpatrick then took up a position to
guard Sherman’s rear, and while doing so, his force loaded
their wagons with the forage and provisions of Burke
County, for use in the less fertile counties in the region
of the coast.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you have consulted the map, you have noticed four
principal rivers on the line of march; the Ocmulgee, the
most westerly, on whose banks is Macon; the Oconee,
on which is situated Milledgeville; the Ogeechee, that
passes Millen, and the Savannah. Augusta is on the latter.
Besides these there were several small streams, and
great swamps across the war-path of General Sherman.
He called the country between Sparta and Warrenton
“one universal bog.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The 4th of December found the great army “swinging
slowly round from its eastern course,” taking Millen
as the pivot, and striking in six columns, along roads
running in the same direction, between the Ogeechee and
Savannah Rivers, for the city of Savannah. General
Sherman at his leisure had secured forage in the rich
counties of Washington, Burke, Glascock, Warren, and
Hancock, to prepare for a formidable resistance at Savannah,
which might delay the communication with Port
Royal for supplies. The rebels said he stopped to “grind
corn;” but, while this was unnecessary, because the
horses could manage the ears, and the troops had better
fare, he was <span class='it'>grinding</span> their hopes of disaster to him and of
escape, to powder. They had sent forces from Charleston
and Wilmington to Augusta and vicinity, sure of meeting
him there, when lo! he was hurrying, like an avalanche,
upon the more important city by the sea. Their feelings,
when the bitter truth came fairly home to their comprehension,
were announced in an Augusta paper: “Sherman
has not for a moment hesitated, in our humble judgment,
as to the point to be attacked or the road to it. When
his forage and provision trains are full he will mass his
entire force; throwing his cavalry to the rear, with his
wagon-train between the two wings of his army, he will
move in compact columns, steadily but cautiously, upon
the city of Savannah, with no fear of an attack on either
flank. The Ogeechee and a few crossings and terrible
swamps on his right, and the Savannah River and its
equally swampy banks on his left, both flanks will be
most securely covered—a grand desideratum in army
movements. And thus situated, he has a march of something
over eighty miles to the city of Savannah.” When
the Augusta people heard that their city was no longer
threatened, they drew a long breath and congratulated
themselves. “The frowns and sadness with which the
countenances of our citizens have been bedecked,” said the
<span class='it'>Sentinel</span>, “have given way to smiles and mirth.” That is,
“smiles and mirth” because their neighbors in Savannah
were to be the recipients of Sherman’s favors, and not they.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Generals Davis and Kilpatrick had hitherto concealed
and guarded the army movements. The Fifteenth Corps,
on the right bank of the river, instead of the left wing,
now menaced the enemy’s rear. These flank manœuvres
of the dashing Kilpatrick, joined to General Howard as he
had been to General Davis, were indispensable; for our
battalions could not clear the State of rebel troops, and
must, therefore, avoid the delays which would attend the
opposition of a much smaller force at the river-crossings,
or any other spot where the difficulties of advance favored
the enemy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The army found the once magnificent cotton fields
some of them having a thousand acres covered with corn,
according to the order of Jeff Davis, while the fleecy
crops of former harvests had been sent to a safer distance
from the suspected course of General Sherman’s columns.
At Ogeechee Church, on the river bearing that name, and
the narrowest part of the peninsula between the streams,
the army concentrated on the 5th and 6th of December.
Meanwhile General Kilpatrick, when dashing toward
Alexandria to burn the bridge over Brier Creek, encountered
General Wheeler at Waynesboro’. The sabres
gleam in the sunlight, and the bullets fly on their fatal
mission, resulting at each conflict in the flight of the rebel
general. The seventy-nine miles from Millen to Savannah
steadily diminished, the splendid and triumphant
army getting by the 8th within less than a score of miles
from the goal of their martial and patriotic ambition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heroic General Howard, at this crisis of affairs,
executed a bold and brilliant movement. The rebels, to
hold the Gulf Railroad, which they were using in earnest,
had pushed across the Ogeechee. General Corse, of “Allatoona
memory,” who, before they were aware of it, was
between the Little and Great Ogeechee, thirteen miles in
advance of the main army, reached and bridged the canal
connecting the river with Savannah, then crossing it, intrenched
himself securely, almost in sight of the city.
And now the approach was hotly disputed, and brave
men fell in the ranks of General Blair’s columns. But
some were killed by the most cowardly and shameful conduct
of the enemy. Shells and torpedoes had been buried
in the way of the march, and the tread of the heroes exploding
them, a number were prostrated in a sudden and
horrible death. The precaution then taken was a just
though severe one. Prisoners of war were ordered forward
to remove the murderous and unseen means of destruction.
The prisoners were sent in advance as ordered.
Crawling, begging, praying, as their trembling fingers
descended to dig away the earth about the death-traps
which they had, perhaps, helped to set, they were a piteous
spectacle. Soon the path was cleared for the onward
steps of the Union boys. General Howard’s next daring
deed was to communicate immediately with our fleet below
Fort McAllister, held by a strong garrison of the
enemy. Here, on the gunboat <span class='it'>Dandelion</span>, Admiral
Dahlgren was anxiously waiting for tidings from the
great army somewhere between Atlanta and the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the evening of December 9th General Howard
sent three of his trustiest scouts, Captain Duncan, and
Sergeants Myron J. Emmick and George W. Quinly, in
a small boat down the river. What a moment of thrilling
interest to both the General and the brave daring fellows
floating over the waters in that frail bark, right toward
bristling McAllister! All was silent—the speck glided under
the cover of darkness safely by, and hastened toward the
<span class='it'>Dandelion</span>. Up went a white signal flag, and another
from the little boat answered it. The scouts were soon
on board the gunboat. Captain Duncan brought the following
despatch from General Howard:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Headquarters Army of the Tennessee,</span> }</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Near Savannah Canal</span>, <span class='it'>Dec. 9, 1864</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>

<p class='hang'>“<span class='it'>To the Commander of the United States Naval Forces in the vicinity of Savannah</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>: We have met with perfect success thus far.
The troops are in fine spirits and near by.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“Respectfully,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='sc'>O. O. Howard</span>, Major-General,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;'>Commanding Right Wing of the Army.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the first intelligence direct from the army,
and “completely dispelled all doubts and fears, as well as
dissipated an immense amount of rebel bombast and boasting
of the impediments and difficulties with which Sherman
had met, to say nothing of the repeated total annihilation
of Kilpatrick’s cavalry, which seems not to have
been worthy of mention by General Howard or General
Sherman. Wheeler, who at last accounts was ‘hacking
away at Sherman’s rear,’ must have had a very dull sabre.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gallant Hazen was preparing, with his western
boys, to storm Fort McAllister, according to General
Sherman’s orders. On the Ogeechee, opposite the fort,
stood the rice mill of Dr. Cheroe, from whose roof the
view of the fortress was distinct. There you might have
seen Generals Sherman and Howard, with staff and signal
officers about them. He was waiting for General
Hazen’s signals, and gazing away toward the sea for
some sign of the fleet’s presence there. Suddenly a smile
lights up the bronzed face of the eagle-eyed leader of the
Union legions, and he exclaims:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Look! Howard; there is the gunboat!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time passed on, and the vessel now became visible,
yet no signal from the fleet or Hazen. Half an hour passed,
and the guns of the fort opened simultaneously with puffs
of smoke that rose a few hundred yards from the fort,
showing that Hazen’s skirmishers had opened. A moment
after Hazen signalled:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I have invested the fort, and will assault immediately.’
At this moment Bickley announces ‘A signal
from the gunboat.’ All eyes are turned from the fort to
the gunboat that is coming to our assistance with news
from home. A few messages pass, which inform us that
Foster and Dahlgren are within speaking distance. The
gunboat now halts and asks—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Can we run up? Is Fort McAllister ours?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘No,’ is the reply, ‘Hazen is just ready to storm it.
Can you assist?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Yes,’ is the reply. ‘What will you have us do?’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But before Sherman can reply to Dahlgren the
thunders of the fort are heard, and the low sound of small
arms borne across three miles of marsh and river. Field
glasses are opened, and sitting flat upon the roof the
hero of Atlanta gazes away off to the fort. ‘There they
go grandly; not a waver,’ he remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Twenty seconds pass, and again he exclaims:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘See that flag in the advance, Howard; how steadily
it moves; not a man falters.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;There they go still;
see the roll of musketry. Grand! grand!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still he strained his eyes, and a moment after speaks
without raising his eyes:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘That flag still goes forward; there is no flinching
there.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pause for a minute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Look!’ he exclaims, ‘it has halted. They waver;
no! it’s the parapet! There they go again; now they
scale it; some are over. Look! there’s a flag on the
works! Another, another. It’s ours! The fort’s ours!’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The glass dropped by his side; and in an instant the
joy of the great leader at the possession of the river and
the opening of the road to his new base burst forth in
words:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘As the old darkie remarked, dis chile don’t sleep
dis night!’ And turning to one of his aids, Captain
Auderied, he remarked, ‘Have a boat for me at once; I
must go there,’ pointing to the fort, from which half a
dozen battle flags floated grandly in the sunset.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And well might William Tecumseh Sherman rejoice;
for here, as the setting sun went down upon Fort
McAllister reduced, and kissed a fond good night to the
Starry Banner, Sherman witnessed the culmination of
all his plans and marches, that had involved such desperate
resistance and risk, the opening up of a new and
shorter route to his base. Here at sunset, on the memorable
13th of December, the dark waters of the great
Ogeechee bore witness to the fulfilment of the covenant
Sherman made with his iron heroes at Atlanta twenty-nine
days before, to lead them victorious to a new base.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sherman’s account of his movement on Fort McAllister
was characteristic. Said he, ‘I went down with
Howard and took a look at it, and I said to my boys,
“Boys, I don’t think there are over four hundred in that
fort; but there it is, and I think we might as well have
it.” ’ The word was scarcely spoken before the work
was done. Fifteen minutes were all that was required.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The object of this fortress was the protection of the
coast from our war vessels. It was surrounded by obstructions
made of rows of piles, through which was a
small opening for a ship’s entrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Sherman sent word to the fleet “that he
would be down that night, and to look out for his boat.
The tug immediately steamed down to Ossabaw Sound,
to find General Foster or Admiral Dahlgren; but they
not being there, despatches were sent to them at Warsaw
announcing General Sherman’s intended visit, and the
tug returned to its old position. While approaching the
fort again a small boat was seen coming down. It was
hailed with—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘What boat is that?’ and the welcome response
came back ‘Sherman.’ It soon came alongside, and out
of the little dugout, paddled by two men, stepped General
Sherman and General Howard, and stood on the deck of
the <span class='it'>Dandelion</span>. The great leader was received with cheer
after cheer, and with every manifestation of delight and
satisfaction by all. He was in splendid spirits, and expressed
his gratification at reaching his base. He remained
on board till about two o’clock in the morning.
While on the boat he wrote his despatches to General
Grant, General Halleck, General Foster, and Admiral
Dahlgren.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the following day he came on board the <span class='it'>Nemaha</span>,
and was received by General Foster. The <span class='it'>Nemaha</span>
then proceeded to Warsaw Sound, when Admiral Dahlgren,
accompanied by his staff, came on board and spent some
time in conversation with the General. Colonel A. H.
Markland, superintendent of mails for the armies, came
on board with despatches for General Sherman, and delivered
a verbal message from the President. Taking
the General by the hand, the Colonel said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘General Sherman, before leaving Washington I
was directed by the President to take you by the hand,
wherever I met you, and say for him, ‘God bless you
and the army under your command;’ and he furthermore
added, ‘Since cutting loose from Atlanta, my
prayers, and those of the nation, have been for your success.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Sherman seemed to be deeply affected, and
after a moment’s silence could only say, ‘I thank the
President. Say my army is all right.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meanwhile Admiral Dahlgren sent a despatch to the
Government, in which he said of the army’s success and
the brave scouts:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Captain Duncan states that our forces were in contact
with the rebels a few miles outside of Savannah, and
that Sherman’s army are not in want of any thing. Perhaps
no event could give greater satisfaction to the country
than that which I announced, and I beg leave to congratulate
the United States Government on its occurrence.
It may, perhaps, be exceeding my province, but
I cannot refrain from expressing the hope that the department
will commend Captain Duncan and his companions
to the Hon. Secretary of War for some marks of approbation,
for the success in establishing communications
between General Sherman and the fleet. It was an enterprise
that required both skill and courage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was followed by a message from General Sherman:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>On Board ‘Dandelion,’</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>Ossabaw Sound</span>, 11.50 <span class='sc'>p. m.</span>, <span class='it'>Dec. 13</span>. }</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day, at 5 <span class='sc'>p. m.</span>, General Hazen’s division of the
Fifteenth Corps carried Fort McAllister by assault, capturing
its entire garrison and stores. This opened to us
the Ossabaw Sound, and I pulled down to this gunboat
to communicate with the fleet. Before opening communication,
we had completely destroyed all the railroads leading
into Savannah, and invested the city. The left is on
the Savannah River, three miles above the city, and the
right is on the Ogeechee River, at King’s Bridge. The
army is in splendid order and equal to any thing. The
weather has been fine and supplies abundant. Our march
was most agreeable, and we were not at all molested by
guerillas. We reached Savannah three days ago, but
owing to Fort McAllister we could not communicate;
now we have McAllister, we go ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have already captured two boats on the Savannah
River, and have prevented their gunboats from coming
down. I estimate the population of Savannah at twenty-five
thousand and the garrison at fifteen thousand. General
Hardee commands. We have not lost a wagon on
the trip, but have gathered in a large supply of mules,
negroes, horses, etc., and our teams are in far better condition
than when we started. My first duty will be to
clear the army of surplus negroes, mules, and horses.
We have utterly destroyed over two hundred miles of railroad,
and consumed stores and provisions that were essential
to Lee’s and Hood’s armies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The quick work made with Fort McAllister, and the
opening of communication with our fleet and consequent
independence for supplies, dissipate all their boasted
threats to head me off and starve the army. I regard
Savannah as already gained. Yours truly,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>W. T. Sherman</span>, Major-General.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fall of the fortress opened, as we have seen, the
Ogeechee River to Ossabaw Sound at its mouth, into which
our vessels sailed; it also gave General Sherman the opportunity
of establishing a “water-base” anywhere on
that stream between his army and the sea, just back of
Savannah. It did more; the Savannah and the Albany
and Gulf Railroads communicating with the southern
part of the State, were taken from the enemy, cutting off
large supplies. The next move was to stretch the army
across the peninsula between the rivers, the left resting
on the Savannah, three miles above the city, and the extreme
right on the Ogeechee at King’s Bridge. All the
railways were in our possession, the rebel gunboats which
had gone up the Ogeechee to prevent General Sherman
from crossing into South Carolina were shut in, and the
commander-in-chief prepared to seize the beautiful town.
Savannah, the largest city of Georgia, was founded by
General Oglethorpe in 1731−’32.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ocean side of the town was well guarded with
fortifications—those grim and silent watchmen when unmolested,
whose voice is thunder, and their words massive
globes of iron, frowned along the river-banks. Forts
Jackson and Pulaski were formidable defences; so much
so that even the engineer, Beauregard, did not dream of
an approach in the rear of the invested city. General
Hardee commanded the forces keeping it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The forces of General Sherman were so posted, that
Hardee had to divide and weaken his force to be ready
for any attack, while the rice-fields were flooded from
the canals, and every advantage taken by the enemy to
ward off the impending blow. This is the general view
of the situation, December 13th, 1864. Such was the
derided <span class='it'>retreat</span> of General Sherman, after General Hood
swept backward from burning Atlanta into Tennessee!
I need not record here what the noble Thomas, with tried
veterans, did with the rebel general at Nashville, sending
his battalions “whirling” toward his invaded Secessia,
just as the comprehensive genius of the pursuer had
planned, and confidently expected he would. For, the
glory of this marvellous campaign, under God, belongs to
that sagacious, resolute, and modest chieftain.</p>

The Surrender of the City demanded—The Refusal—Preparation to Attack—The
Enemy Flee—The Entrance of the Union Army—Scenes that followed—General
Sherman and the Negroes.
</div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/d.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='D'/>ECEMBER 20th, Fort Lee and other defences
of Savannah had been taken, but there was left
a single narrow path of escape for the beleaguered
enemy—the Union Causeway, just below Hutchinson’s
Island, which it was difficult for our
troops to reach. But General Sherman had his eye on
this outlet, intending to secure it within a day or two,
shutting in General Hardee and his army. The next
morning a flag of truce was sent toward the city gates,
under whose protection was conveyed the demand for its
surrender. The brief message of General Sherman closed
with the words which General Hood used in his call for
the surrender of Dalton, a few months before, with its
negro troops:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the demand is not complied with, I shall take no
prisoners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Hardee replied defiantly, declaring that he
had men and supplies for a successful defence. This was
done to deceive the army closing like the coil of an anaconda
about him. General Sherman suspected it, but the
officers generally expected a battle. The preparations
for assault went forward rapidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rebel chief improved his opportunity, and suddenly
decamped under cover of night, defiling along the causeway
while our weary troops were resting on their arms.
He had stationed his iron-clads near Hutchinson’s Island,
which, with the battalions on its lower end, protected the
highway of the flying thousands whose arms reflected the
glare of the burning Navy Yard, fired during the evacuation.
The thunder of exploding iron-clads, destroyed by
the rear-guard, was the last signal of his retreat from the
boastful Hardee: “The night was exceedingly propitious
for such an operation. It was dark and a heavy wind
was blowing from the west, conveying the sound of
trampling feet over the pontoons away from our lines.
But during some of the lulls that occurred General Geary,
commanding the Second division, Twentieth Corps, the
extreme left of our lines resting on the Savannah River,
heard the movement across the bridge, but could not decide
in which direction the troops were passing. He
ordered his division to be ready at a moment’s notice to
move, and then watched the progress of affairs. At midnight
General Geary became convinced in his own mind
that the enemy were evacuating the town, and notified
the commanding general of this fact. The enemy’s skirmish
line continued a fusilade on our pickets, and did not
cease until two or three o’clock, when they were drawn
in, and not many moments after our picket line was advanced,
and meeting no opposition, rushed still further on,
crawled through the abatis, floundered through the ditches,
and scrambled over the parapets and found the first line
deserted. General Geary immediately advanced his
division, occupied the line and pushed on toward the
city. The second line was found abandoned as well,
and General Geary, at the head of a small body of men,
hurried on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the following morning, December 21st, the <span class='it'>Savannah
Republican</span>, which two days before emulated the departed
commander in the language of defiance—hurling the
anathemas of southern chivalry upon the “Yankees”—came
out with an earnest appeal to the citizens, counselling
quiet and decorum, and the use of all proper means
to secure the “<span class='it'>respect of a magnanimous foe</span>.” What a
strange revolution in tactics—a marvellous light streamed
into the city and the editor’s “sanctum” along the causeway
from the wake of the fugitive “Greybacks.” Before
General Geary “had entered the city, Mayor Arnold, of
the city, with four or five of the commonalty, rode up
and surrendered the city to him unconditionally, and
expressed a trust in the magnanimity of an honorable
foe for the safety of the lives and property of the inhabitants.
General Geary accepted the surrender unconditionally,
and assured them that their lives and
property should be protected. He then entered the
city, despatching Captain Veale of his staff, with four
hundred men, to take possession of Fort Jackson; and
also another member of his staff to General Slocum, to
inform him of his occupation of the town. The officer
who bore this message had some difficulty in convincing
our soldiers that Geary’s division was in town. They said
to him, ‘You can’t come that, Johnnie Reb. The game
is an old one and will not work.’ Finally he assured
them sufficiently to gain a passage, and delivered his
despatch to General Slocum, commanding the left wing
of the army. At eight o’clock all the enemy’s works
were in our possession. Captain Veale, with his party,
took possession of Fort Jackson and Fort Barlow, taking
about sixty heavy guns in both works and lines connecting
with them. The enemy had fired the barracks, but
the fire was soon subdued.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the haste of his departure Hardee strangely
neglected to destroy the ammunition of the forts, and
the cotton in the city. Only a portion of the guns
left behind were spiked. Munitions of war, more than
30,000 bales of cotton, and railroad rolling stock, fell into
our hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Sherman’s entry into the town was marked
by no extraordinary commotion. The city received him
quietly and respectfully, though not with open arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The population of Savannah, during the past thirty
days, has been immensely increased by emigration from
the interior. Thousands of people, including many
wealthy families, fled from the country threatened by
General Sherman’s march, to find, as they presumed, an
undisturbed refuge in the city. The houses overflow with
them; numbers dwell in sheds, and live upon the streets.
Negroes form a large part of this transient population.
Many rebel officers and soldiers are found concealed in
houses, and probably considerable valuable property, not
yet estimated in the fruits of this almost bloodless siege,
will yet be brought to light likewise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A number of prisoners, which may be counted in
addition to those found in the city, were previously captured
during our advance against the enemy’s works.
Colonel Clinch, of General Hardee’s staff, with thirty
men, was taken on board a transport in the Savannah
River a few days before the surrender. A quantity of
whiskey was aboard the transport, and when our officers
reached it, every man on board, except Colonel Clinch,
was found in a state of beastly intoxication. General
Harrison, a militia general, and a man of considerable
wealth, residing near the city, was also taken prisoner
during the siege.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the sun of December 21st was moving toward
the zenith, General Sherman rode at the head of his enthusiastic
columns, with music and banners enlivening the
magnificent scene, into the broad, quiet streets of Savannah,
followed by his wing-commanders, the gallant Howard
and Slocum. Hour after hour the tramp of Union
soldiers echoes on the pavements, until at length, in mansions,
public buildings, and tents, the exultant host settled
down into comparative repose. The next day the wires
of the telegraph transmitted to the President this laconic
message:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Savannah, Ga.</span>, <span class='it'>December 22, 1864</span>.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;font-size:.8em;'>“<span class='it'>His Excellency President Lincoln</span>;</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg to present you as a Christmas gift the city of
Savannah, with one hundred and fifty heavy guns and
plenty of ammunition, and also about twenty-five thousand
bales of cotton.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>W. T. Sherman</span>, Major-General.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all the world’s history of the Christmas times, was
there ever a gift so memorable, or one more worthy to
receive it? You will always recollect it with the delight
expressed by a playful pen: “The sugar plum which
Sherman dropped into the national stocking that Abraham
Lincoln hung up, came in the semblance of Savannah.
We have all enjoyed it. We have admired its roundness
and its sweetness. We rejoice over the one hundred and
fifty heavy guns, and the thirty-three thousand bales of
cotton. The capture of Savannah is an event which we
have long anticipated, and are therefore only quietly enjoying
it. Reaching us, as the intelligence did, on a day
that was meteorologically gloomy, it shed an interior sunlight
brighter than a more substantial one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The quartermaster, in General Sherman’s behalf, a
little later announced, that “all persons wishing to leave
the city under existing orders, and go within the Confederate
lines, are informed that the steamer <span class='it'>F. R. Spalding</span>
will be in readiness at the wharf at the foot of Drayton
Street, at six o’clock <span class='sc'>a. m.</span> on Wednesday, the 11th instant,
to transport them to Charleston, S. C. Wagons
and ambulances will be sent to the residences of families,
to take them and their baggage to the boat. As there are
no conveniences on the boat to provide food, each family
had better provide itself with what it will require for
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Applications for wagons and ambulances must be
made to Captain J. E. Remington, assistant quartermaster,
last house on the west end of Jones Street, south side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>About two hundred citizens availed themselves of the
opportunity thus offered them to rejoin their relatives or
friends within the enemy’s lines. The new paper, the
<span class='it'>Loyal Georgian</span>, thus hoisted its flag, with the notices following:
“The mind that conceived, and the arm that,
under Omnipotence, could execute these grand army
movements, has not yet finished its work. That same
powerful body which with its gigantic wings swept over the
State of Georgia as a whirlwind, must yet move on its
irresistible course until the whole land shall acknowledge
the power and authority of the Government of the United
States. When that day comes, the commander will lay
aside his laurels, the soldier his sword, and this broad
and fair abounding land of ours shall once more teem
with the busy hum of peaceful life. May a merciful God
grant the happy day soon to be ushered in upon us, and
peace, sweet peace! be our portion; but until the ‘last
armed foe expires,’ the army of the Union will and must
stand as a bulwark against all destroyers, come from
where they may.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Sherman has his headquarters at the house
of Mr. Charles Green. General Howard’s headquarters
are at the house of Mr. Molyneux, late British consul at
Savannah, who is now in Europe. General Slocum’s
headquarters are at the late residence of Hon. John E.
Ward. General Geary, commandant of the post, has his
office in the Bank building, next door to the Custom
House.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Divine service will be held in the Independent Presbyterian,
the Lutheran, Baptist, St. John’s Church, and
Methodist Churches, to-morrow morning at half-past ten
o’clock, by their respective pastors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The condition of the city under the new rule was very
clearly given by rebel papers. January 10th, the Richmond
<span class='it'>Whig</span>, whose hatred of the North has been unsurpassed,
was compelled to confess that General Sherman
was wise and humane in his administration, as an extract
will show:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Augusta <span class='it'>Chronicle</span> and <span class='it'>Sentinel</span> of the 4th instant
publishes a number of news items, derived from a
gentleman who left Savannah on the 1st instant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The most perfect order is maintained in the city.
No soldier is allowed to interfere with the citizens in any
particular. A citizen was arrested by a drunken soldier
a few days since. The citizen knocked the soldier down.
The officer of the guard, as soon as he arrived, said
nothing to the citizen, but had the soldier taken to the barracks,
gagged and soundly whipped for his misbehavior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A drunken soldier, who undertook to create a disturbance
recently, and who refused to allow himself to be
arrested, was shot down at once by the guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One or two of the Insurance Companies of Savannah
are considering the project of establishing a National Bank
for the issue of ‘greenbacks.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Custom House and Post Office are being cleaned
and repaired, preparatory to the commencement of business
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The soldiers are not allowed under any circumstances
whatever to enter private residences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The negroes in most cases are orderly and quiet, remaining
with their owners and performing their customary
duties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One store with goods from the North has already
been opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing but ‘greenbacks’ are in circulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The churches on Sundays are well filled with ladies.
On week days, however, but few of them are seen on the
streets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A majority of the male population have remained
in the city. The families of most of the men who have
left still remain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A majority of the citizens have provisions for some
time to come, but there is a scarcity of wood, but General
Sherman has announced that he will soon remedy this last
difficulty by getting wood via the Gulf Railway, and hauling
it to the citizens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No pass is allowed to any male person to go toward
the city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All females who are caught going toward the city
are thoroughly searched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eleven hundred loaves of good baker’s bread, which
had been collected for the soldiers of Sherman’s army,
but for which authorized agents did not call, were on
Thursday turned over to the Poor Association of Savannah
by the Committee acting in behalf of the Soldier’s
Dinner, and were yesterday distributed to the poor of the
city. It was truly a kind and providential gift, for the
city is entirely out of breadstuffs of every kind, and for
days past have been unable to issue a pound of meal or
flour to the hundreds who were sorely in need of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Sherman had a very summary way of answering
inquiries of the citizens on whose lips was the gall
of secession. To a proud lady who said to him: “General,
you may conquer, but you can’t subjugate us,” he
instantly replied, “I don’t want to subjugate you, I mean
to kill you, the whole of you, if you don’t stop this rebellion.”
In conversation a short time since with several
citizens of Savannah on the subject of the war, General
Sherman, in his characteristic manner, remarked: “We
wish to cultivate friendly feeling with your people; if they
love monarchy we will not quarrel with them; but we
love a strong republic and mean to maintain it.” He
also said he had been through Mississippi twice and
through Georgia once. “The sun goes North on the
21st, and by that time I shall be ready to go North, too.”
In a private letter to a distinguished military man in
New York, his noble and magnanimous spirit appears:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Colonel Ewing arrived to-day, and bore me many
kind tokens from the North, but none gave me more
satisfaction than to know that you watched with interest
my efforts in the national cause. I do not think a human
being could feel more kindly toward an enemy than I do
to the people of the South, and I only pray that I may
live to see the day when they and their children will
thank me, as one who labored to secure and maintain a
Government worthy the land we have inherited, and
strong enough to secure our children the peace and security
denied us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Judging from the press, the world magnifies my
deeds above their true value, and I fear the future may
not realize its judgment. But whatever fate may befall
me, I know that you will be a generous and charitable
critic, and will encourage one who only hopes in this
struggle to do a man’s share.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days later a gentleman addressed a note to General
Sherman, asking questions designed to draw from
him his views upon the prospects of Georgia, and her
relations to the General Government. His reply is marked
with his original thought, and reveals his high ability
as a statesman:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Headquarters Military Division of the Mississippi,</span> }</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>In the Field, Savannah, Ga.</span>, <span class='it'>Jan. 8, 1865</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;font-size:.8em;'>“<span class='it'>N. W——, Esq., —— County, Ga.</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: Yours of the 3d instant is received,
and in answer to your inquiries, I beg to state I am
merely a military commander, and act only in that capacity;
nor can I give any assurances or pledges affecting
civil matters in the future. They will be adjusted by Congress
when Georgia is again represented there as of old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Georgia is not out of the Union, and therefore the
talk of ‘reconstruction’ appears to me inappropriate.
Some of the people have been and still are in a state of
revolt; and as long as they remain armed and organized,
the United States must pursue them, with armies,
and deal with them according to military law. But as
soon as they break up their armed organizations and return
to their homes, I take it they will be dealt with by
the civil courts. Some of the rebels in Georgia, in my
judgment, deserve death, because they have committed
murder, and other crimes, which are punished with death
by all civilized governments on earth. I think this was
the course indicated by General Washington, in reference
to the Whiskey Insurrection, and a like principle
seemed to be recognized at the time of the Burr conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As to the Union of the States under our Government,
we have the high authority of General Washington,
who bade us be jealous and careful of it, and the still
more emphatic words of General Jackson, ‘The Federal
Union, it must and shall be preserved.’ Certainly Georgians
cannot question the authority of such men, and
should not suspect our motives, who are simply fulfilling
their commands. Wherever necessary, force has been
used to carry out that end; and you may rest assured
that the Union will be preserved, cost what it may.
And if you are sensible men you will conform to this
order of things or else migrate to some other country.
There is no other alternative open to the people of
Georgia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My opinion is, that no negotiations are necessary,
nor commissioners, nor conventions, nor any thing of the
kind. Whenever the people of Georgia quit rebelling
against their Government and elect members of Congress
and Senators, and these go and take their seats, then the
State of Georgia will have resumed her functions in the
Union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These are merely my opinions, but in confirmation
of them, as I think, the people of Georgia may well consider
the following words referring to the people of the
rebellious States, which I quote from the recent annual
message of President Lincoln to Congress at its present
session;</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘They can at any moment have peace simply by
laying down their arms and submitting to the national
authority under the Constitution. After so much, the
Government would not, if it could, maintain war against
them. The loyal people would not sustain or allow it.
If questions should remain we would adjust them by the
peaceful means of legislation, conference, courts, and
votes. Operating only in constitutional and lawful channels,
some certain and other possible questions are and
would be beyond the Executive power to adjust, as, for
instance, the admission of members into Congress and
whatever might require the appropriation of money.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The President then alludes to the general pardon
and amnesty offered for more than a year past, upon
specified and more liberal terms, to all except certain
designated classes, even these being ‘still within contemplation
of special clemency,’ and adds:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘It is still so open to all, but the time may come
when public duty shall demand that it be closed, and that
in lieu more vigorous measures than heretofore shall be
adopted.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me that it is time for the people of
Georgia to act for themselves, and return, in time, to
their duty to the Government of their fathers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>W. T. Sherman</span>, Major-General.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bearing the same date of this able letter, are his
words of congratulation to his rejoicing army:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>In the Field, Savannah, Ga.</span>, <span class='it'>Jan. 8</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The General Commanding announces to the troops
composing the military division of the Mississippi, that he
has received from the President of the United States and
from Lieutenant-General Grant, letters conveying the
high sense and appreciation of the campaign just closed,
resulting in the capture of Savannah and the defeat of
Hood’s army in Tennessee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In order that all may understand the importance
of events, it is proper to revert to the situation of affairs in
September last. We held Atlanta, a city of little value
to us, but so important to the enemy that Mr. Davis, the
head of the rebellious faction in the South, visited his
army near Palmetto, and commanded it to regain it, as
well as to ruin and destroy us by a series of measures
which he thought would be effectual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That army, by a rapid march, first gained our railroad
near Big Shanty, and afterward about Dalton. We
pursued, but it marched so rapidly that we could not
overtake it, and General Hood led his army successfully
far toward Mississippi, in hopes to decoy us out of Georgia.
But we were not then to be led away by him, and
purposed to control and lead events ourselves. Generals
Thomas and Schofield, commanding the department to
our rear, returned to their posts, and prepared to decoy
General Hood into their meshes, while we came on to
complete our original journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We quietly and deliberately destroyed Atlanta and
all the railroads which the enemy had used to carry on
war against us; occupied his State capital, and then
captured his commercial capital, which had been so
strongly fortified from the sea as to defy approach from
that quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Almost at the moment of our victorious entry into
Savannah came the welcome and expected news that our
comrades in Tennessee had also fulfilled, nobly and well,
their part; had decoyed General Hood to Nashville, and
then turned on him, defeating his army thoroughly, capturing
all his artillery, great numbers of prisoners, and
were still pursuing the fragments down into Alabama.
So complete a success in military operations, extending
over half a continent, is an achievement that entitles it to
a place in the military history of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The armies serving in Georgia and Tennessee, as
well as the local garrisons of Decatur, Bridgeport, Chattanooga,
and Murfreesborough, are alike entitled to the
common honor, and each regiment may inscribe on its
colors at pleasure the words ‘Savannah,’ or ‘Nashville.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The General Commanding embraces in the same
general success the operations of the cavalry column
under Generals Stoneman, Burbridge, and Gillem, that
penetrated into Southwestern Virginia, and paralyzed the
efforts of the enemy to disturb the peace and safety of the
people of East Tennessee. Instead of being put on the
defensive, we have, at all points, assumed the bold offensive,
and completely thwarted the designs of the enemies
of our country. By order of</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was followed on the 14th by a message regulating
the trade and social life of the people:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>In the Field, Savannah, Ga.</span>, <span class='it'>Jan. 14</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It being represented that the Confederate army and
armed bands of robbers, acting professedly under the
authority of the Confederate government, are harassing
the people of Georgia and endeavoring to intimidate them
in the efforts they are making to secure to themselves
provisions, clothing, security to life and property, and the
restoration of law and good government in the State, it is
hereby ordered and made public:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I. That the farmers of Georgia may bring into
Savannah, Fernandina, or Jacksonville, Fla., marketing,
such as beef, pork, mutton, vegetables of any kinds, fish,
&amp;c., as well as cotton in small quantities, and sell the
same in open market, except the cotton, which must be
sold by or through the Treasury agents, and may invest
the proceeds in family stores, such as bacon and flour, in
any reasonable quantities, groceries, shoes, and clothing,
and articles not contraband of war, and carry the
same back to them families. No trade-store will be attempted
in the interior, or stocks of goods sold for them,
but families may club together for mutual assistance and
protection in coming and going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“II. The people are encouraged to meet together in
peaceful assemblages to discuss measures looking to their
safety and good government, and the restoration of State
and national authority, and will be protected by the national
army when so doing; and all peaceable inhabitants
who satisfy the commanding officers that they are earnestly
laboring to that end, must not only be left undisturbed
in property and person, but must be protected as
far as possible consistent with the military operations.
If any farmer or peaceful inhabitant is molested by the
enemy, viz., the Confederate army of guerillas, because
of his friendship to the National Government, the perpetrator,
if caught, will be summarily punished, or his
family made to suffer for the outrage; but if the crime
cannot be traced to the actual party, then retaliation
will be made on the adherents to the cause of the rebellion.
Should a Union man be murdered, then a rebel
selected by lot will be shot; or if a Union family be persecuted
on account of the cause, a rebel family will be
banished to a foreign land. In aggravated cases, retaliation
will extend as high as five for one. All commanding
officers will act promptly in such cases, and report their
action after the retaliation is done. By order of</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“Major-General <span class='sc'>W. T. Sherman</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have now a very remarkable interview between
a delegation of the negro population, including
twenty men, nearly all of whom were preachers, and
Secretary Stanton and General Sherman. There were
members of the parishes whose pastors were present,
worth from $3,000 to $30,000. Rev. Garrison Frazier,
sixty-seven years of age, was the speaker. The answers
to various questions touching slavery, the war, and the
ability of the negroes to take care of themselves, were
promptly and intelligently answered. After General
Sherman had left the room, an inquiry touching their
opinion of General Sherman was made, with the following
reply:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We looked upon General Sherman prior to his
arrival as a man in the Providence of God specially
set apart to accomplish this work, and we unanimously
feel inexpressible gratitude to him, looking upon him as
a man that should be honored for the faithful performance
of his duty. Some of us called on him immediately
upon his arrival, and it is probable he would not meet
the Secretary with more courtesy than he met us. His
conduct and deportment toward us characterized him as
a friend and a gentleman. We have confidence in General
Sherman, and think whatever concerns us could not
be under better management.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conference was followed by the following order:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Headquarters Military Div. of the Miss.,</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'><span class='sc'>In the Field, Savannah, Ga.</span>, <span class='it'>Jan. 16, 1865</span>. }</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I. The islands from Charleston, south, the abandoned
rice-fields along the river for thirty miles back
from the sea, and the country bordering the St. John
River, Florida, are reserved and set apart for the settlement
of the negroes now made free by the acts of war
and the President of the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“II. At Beaufort, Hilton Head, Savannah, Fernandina,
St. Augustine, and Jacksonville, the blacks may
remain in their chosen or accustomed avocations; but on
the islands, and in the settlements hereafter to be established,
no white person whatever, unless military officers
and soldiers detailed for duty, will be permitted to reside;
and the sole and exclusive management of affairs will be
left to the freed people themselves, subject only to the
United States military authority and the acts of Congress.
By the laws of war, and orders of the President of the
United States, the negro is free, and must be dealt with
as such. He cannot be subjected to conscription or
forced military service, save by the written orders of the
highest military authority of the department, under such
regulations as the President or Congress may prescribe.
Domestic servants, blacksmiths, carpenters, and other
mechanics, will be free to select their own work and
residence; but the young and able-bodied negroes must
be encouraged to enlist as soldiers in the service of the
United States, to contribute their share toward maintaining
their own freedom, and securing their rights as
citizens of the United States. Negroes so enlisted will
be organized into companies, battalions, and regiments,
under the orders of the United States military authorities,
and will be paid, fed, and clothed according to law. The
bounties paid on enlistment may, with the consent of the
recruit, go to assist his family and settlement in procuring
agricultural implements, seed, tools, boats, clothing,
and other articles necessary for their livelihood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“III. Whenever three respectable negroes, heads of
families, shall desire to settle on land, and shall have
selected for that purpose an island or a locality clearly
defined within the limits above designated, the Inspector
of Settlements and Plantations will himself, or by such
subordinate officer as he may appoint, give them a license
to settle such island or district, and afford them such assistance
as he can to enable them to establish a peaceable
agricultural settlement. The three parties named will
subdivide the land, under the supervision of the inspector,
among themselves and such others as may choose to
settle near them, so that each family shall have a plot of
not more than forty acres of tillable ground, and, when
it borders on some water channel, with not more than
eight hundred feet front, in the possession of which land
the military authorities will afford them protection until
such time as they can protect themselves, or until Congress
shall regulate their title. The quartermaster may,
on the requisition of the Inspector of Settlements and
Plantations, place at the disposal of the inspector one or
more of the captured steamers to ply between the settlements
and one or more of the commercial points heretofore
named in orders, to afford the settlers the opportunity
to supply their necessary wants, and to sell the
products of their land and labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“IV. When a negro has enlisted in the military service
of the United States, he may locate his family in any
of the settlements at pleasure, and acquire a homestead
and all other rights and privileges of a settler as though
present in person. In like manner negroes may settle
their families, and engage on board the gunboats, or in
fishing, or in the navigation of the inland waters, without
losing any claim to land or other advantages derived from
this system. But no one, except an actual settler as above
defined, or unless absent on government services, will be
entitled to claim any right to land or property in any settlement
by virtue of these orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“V. In order to carry out this system of settlement,
a general officer will be detailed as Inspector of
Settlements and Plantations, whose duty it shall be to
visit the settlements, to regulate their police and general
management, and who will furnish personally to each
head of a family, subject to the approval of the President
of the United States, a possessory title in writing,
giving as near as possible the description of boundaries,
and who may adjust all claims or conflicts that may
arise under the same, subject to the like approval, treating
such titles as altogether possessory. The same general
officer will also be charged with the enlistment and
organization of the negro recruits, and protecting their
interests while so absent from their settlements, and will
be governed by the rules and regulations prescribed by
the War Department for such purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“VI. Brigadier-General R. Saxton is hereby appointed
Inspector of Settlements and Plantations, and
will at once enter on the performance of his duties. No
change is intended or desired in the settlement now on
Beaufort Island, nor will any rights to property heretofore
acquired be affected thereby.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“By order of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major-Gen. <span class='sc'>W. T. Sherman</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a kind and honorable provision—giving the
unfortunate race just the opportunity which was desired
of self-culture and progress. They do not desire to come
north and mix with the white population, but own themselves,
and have a fair opportunity for improvement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An “Educational Association” followed, to establish
schools for the freedmen, which should be taught by those
of their own people already possessed of some learning.
All were invited to join it by paying three dollars. The first
evening the number of members swelled the fund to more
than seven hundred dollars. Then five hundred children
were gathered together to be formed into schools. Rev.
J. W. Alvord was a leading philanthropist in the work.
They were divided into ten schools, of fifty scholars, and,
with a teacher at the head of each, marched in a procession
two by two through the city—a strange spectacle
indeed to all beholders! “The procession marched on
till they came to the old Slave-market—a large building,
three stories high. General Geary, who now commands
the city, said they might have this for a school-house. So
they took possession of it, placing the children along the
very platforms where the old slave-traders used to set men
and women to be examined for sale. The fathers and
mothers of the children looked on in wonder to think
what a change had taken place; while many wept joyful
tears, and shouted praises to God who had done such great
things for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But oh, the sad want and suffering of the masses in
the conquered city! All that could be done by General
Sherman to alleviate the famine, was promptly offered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mayor and a few of the citizens had not only a
formal meeting to express loyalty to the Stars and Stripes,
so long dishonored there, but asked for an exchange
of rice for other articles of food. For this purpose a
vessel was sent by permission of the commander-in-chief
to New York. That city, Boston, and Philadelphia, immediately
took measures to forward supplies. The accompanying
message of the mayor of Boston was a fraternal
and excellent tender of former friendship and a renewal
of old associations. When, on January 19th, the steamship
<span class='it'>Rebecca Clyde</span> lay at the wharf with her large cargo
of provisions, the mayor thanked the people of the North
for their generosity, and complimented very warmly the
“wise and impartial administration” of General Geary.
He said: “He has restored order out of chaos, and
made the people of Savannah feel that the Northern army
has not come among them to ruin or pillage them. Life
and property have been as safe during the Federal occupation
as it ever had been under civil rule.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Veale, of General Geary’s staff, replied, assuring
the mayor that the “Federal officers and soldiers
had always treated the people of the South with kindness
and forbearance, and hoped that they would soon again join
in one bond of brotherhood for the preservation and welfare
of our common country. He also thanked the mayor for
his high eulogium on General Geary, and assured him that
the general’s object was to promote the welfare of Savannah
and make her citizens feel that the Northern army
was not inimical to the South.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Savannah in the old Revolutionary days extended her
hand in time of trouble to Massachusetts, whose sons repay
the debt of gratitude with unfeigned delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such were the events and scenes attending the return
of the old flag to its place in Savannah, never again to
be trailed in the dust by traitorous hands.</p>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/w.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='W'/>ITH the advent of the New Year, the friends
of General Sherman in his native State inaugurated
a movement to secure a fitting testimonial
of their appreciation of his brilliant
achievements. A public meeting was called
at Columbus, Ohio, at which Governor Brough presided,
and made the subjoined remarks: “General Sherman
has been identified with our army from the commencement
of the contest. Able and discreet—daring, yet
prudent—ever active and energetic—he has led his forces
with almost universal success. He has been in earnest
from the beginning; and if his life is spared, will so continue
to the end. Sharing the privations and dangers of
his army, and, ever consulting and promoting the comfort
and safety of his men, he has acquired their unlimited
respect and confidence. His State should hold him in
honor, and the nation owes him a debt of gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While Ohio should not boast, she should not allow
her modesty to make her entirely oblivious to the merits
and greatness of her sons. While other States are providing
solid testimonials for men who have perilled their
lives and fortunes, and distinguished themselves in the
cause of the country, we should not hesitate in similar
acts of appreciation and gratitude toward one of our own
citizens who has stood in the foremost rank in all this
contest. On the contrary, we should come to it in the
spirit of zeal and enthusiasm. This movement has been
inaugurated by the people of the city where General
Sherman was born—its originators are gentlemen of high
character and integrity—and our people should cordially
meet it with the determination that it shall be promptly
and fully successful, and the testimonial be at once worthy
of all the State, and its noble, patriotic, and distinguished
citizen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lieutenant-General Grant sent the following expressive
note to the committee having the tribute of grateful
affection in charge:</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sirs</span>: I have just this moment received your
printed letter in relation to your proposed movement in
acknowledgment of one of Ohio’s greatest sons. I wrote
only yesterday to my father, who resides in Covington,
Ky., on the same subject, and asked him to inaugurate a
subscription to present Mrs. Sherman with a house in the
city of Cincinnati. General Sherman is eminently entitled
to this mark of consideration, and I directed my
father to head the subscription with five hundred dollars
for me, and half that amount from General Ingalls, chief
quartermaster of this army, who is equally alive with
myself to the eminent services of General Sherman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whatever direction this enterprise in favor of General
Sherman may take, you may set me down for the
amount named. I cannot say a word too highly in praise
of General Sherman’s services from the beginning of the
rebellion to the present day, and will therefore abstain
from flattery of him. Suffice it to say, the world’s history
gives no record of his superiors, and but few equals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am truly glad for the movement you have set on
foot, and of the opportunity of adding my mite in testimony
of so good and great a man. Yours truly,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>U. S. Grant</span>, Lieutenant-General.”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>How noble and beautiful such evidence of true greatness,
the master minds of the war-field delighting to honor
each other! A frightful conflagration in Savannah was
among the painful incidents of these winter months,
crowded so full of stirring events. The unresting brain
and form of General Sherman had scarcely completed the
new order of things in Savannah, before a still grander
campaign in some of its aspects, one more perilous and decisive
in its results on the rebellion, was planned, and his
glad host waiting his word of command to march. Sherman’s
rule of military action is, not to rest while possible
motion promises substantial results. Looking away from
Savannah toward South Carolina, and beyond to Richmond,
his masterly genius formed deliberately the plan
of advance, which was kept in his own breast. He
threatened several points at once, so that the enemy could
not tell whether he would strike first with an avalanche of
living men, Branchville, Augusta, Columbia, or Charleston.
The “dazzling rapidity” of his movements always
completely paralyzed the foe. To concentrate after he
was fairly in motion, and his immediate object discerned,
in time to successfully stop him, was next to impossible.
We have had no military leader in this intelligent and
irresistible celerity of movement that approaches him.
The Secretary of War announced in the following message
to Mr. Lincoln, the fact, that the laurelled chieftain was
again in the war-path over a hostile country, with continuous
swamps and morasses at the very entrance into
its perils:</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:left;margin-left:0em;font-size:.8em;'>“<span class='it'>To the President</span>:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“General Sherman renewed the movement of his
forces from Savannah, last week. The Fifteenth and
Seventeenth Corps went in transports to Beaufort on
Saturday, the 14th. The Seventeenth Corps, under
Major-General Blair, crossed Port Royal Ferry, and,
with a portion of General Foster’s command, moved on
Pocotaligo. General Howard, commanding that wing of
the army, reported on Sunday, 15th, that the enemy
abandoned his strong works in our front during Saturday
night. General Blair’s corps now occupies a strong position
across the railroad, covering all approaches eastward
to Pocotaligo. All the sick of General Sherman’s army
are in good hospitals at Beaufort and Hilton Head, where
the genial climate affords advantages for recovery superior
to any other place. The peace and order prevailing at
Savannah since its occupation by General Sherman, could
not be surpassed. Few male inhabitants are to be seen
on the streets.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:1em;'>“<span class='sc'>Edwin M. Stanton.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>Refer to a large map, and you will perceive at a
glance the field of operations before General Sherman.
About half way from Savannah to Charleston, is Pocotaligo,
on the direct railroad—an important place, which
was the object of an expedition soon after Beaufort
came into our hands. Its capture secured General Sherman’s
flank from attack in his progress toward Branchville,
a great railway centre, in importance resembling
Atlanta. His advance lay as it did when he approached
Savannah, between two rivers, whose borders were
guarded with swamps. Having carried Pocotaligo Bridge,
on the 13th of January, whose strong garrison had always
successfully repulsed us hitherto, the onward march
from Beaufort commenced. General Hatch’s division
was already occupying a “position not far from the
bridge, with their guns turned on the railroad. The
Seventeenth Corps crossed Port Royal Ferry on a pontoon
bridge laid by the Engineer Corps, and marched
swiftly, but cautiously, to the railroad. The enemy’s
pickets were soon aroused, and attempted some skirmishing,
but were pushed off without trouble. On the
15th, with the Seventeenth Corps on the left, and Hatch’s
troops on the right, after slight resistance, the railroad
was gained, a little south of the bridge. Our skirmishers
dashed lightly ahead, encountered the enemy’s, who were
supported with light artillery, swept them off, gained the
bridge, and a brigade of the Seventeenth charged and
carried it, together with the earthworks at the further
end. Several heavy guns, which the enemy had spiked,
fell into our hands; one of the earthworks carrying seven,
and the other five. The great bridge, with the trestle-work
in the swamp on either side, is fully a mile in
length. The enemy, finding he must give up the work
he had so long defended, tried to burn it. But our men
were too quick for him and saved it. Our loss was only
about fifty killed and wounded. Lieutenant Chandler,
of General Blair’s staff, was killed while leading a gallant
and victorious charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The enemy’s force consisted of General McLaws’s
detachment of Hardee’s forces; and were pushed out of
Pocotaligo, the Seventeenth Corps occupying the railroad
from the Coosawatchie to the Salkehatchie. So soon as
this lodgment was effected, Sherman sent the First and
Third divisions of Geary’s Twentieth Corps, of Slocum’s
column, across the Savannah, so as to hold the railroad
continuously from Savannah to the lines of the Seventeenth
Corps. On the 16th, also, the Fifteenth Corps
embarked at Thunderbolt for Beaufort.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the legions swept toward Branchville, more than
half way to Columbia, the capital of South Carolina, and
northwest of Charleston. The threatening front of our
army against Charleston at the same moment, kept occupied
and apart Generals Beauregard and Hardee. General
Kilpatrick hung like a thunder-cloud around Augusta,
keeping General D. H. Hill with his troops there, while
General Howard’s right wing reached and cut the railroad
below Branchville; General Blair’s Seventeenth
Corps crossed the Salkehatchie, wading waist deep
through the current, defeating the enemy in the very
water, and seizing River’s Bridge; and General Slocum
had gone above Branchville, cutting the railroad there.
This was during the first week in February. Sunday
night, the 11th, the enemy finding Branchville hopelessly
encircled, cutting the paths of communication, fled from
the town, and the next day our victorious troops, with
flying banners, entered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over streams, into which they plunged with a shout;
through morasses, building corduroy roads in swamps,
destroying railroads for nearly a hundred miles of a
single line, the brave boys had got within reach of the
“tempting prize,” as the Columbia <span class='it'>Guardian</span> called it,
now seventy miles distant, and a hundred and forty-three
from Augusta, Georgia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That paper began to use quite different speech from
that addressed a few weeks before to the “gentle warrior.”
He thus discoursed to the people: “South Carolinians
are not to be intimidated by the fulminations of a
brutal foe, and we are mistaken if South Carolinians
have forgotten how to treat the insolence of the hireling.”
The same paper said that Columbia would not even be
approached, because Sherman was bent on Charleston.
“To believe it is contrary to common sense, contrary to
a knowledge of Sherman’s character and confessed determination,
and contrary to all military strategy. Possibly
a <span class='it'>raid</span> may be made here for the purpose of creating
a diversion. It will not find us unprepared. Long
before Columbia falls, we look for a battle and a victory.”
Sherman, however, having left Branchville, was marching
over the fine, high, fertile region northward, where
supplies were abundant, and the country roads excellent.
Already he was aiming at Kingsville, where he would,
if successful in his object, at one fell swoop destroy the
Columbia and Charleston Railroad, and the Wilmington
and Manchester Railroad. “That he will succeed in
doing this, we have doubts—very grave doubts; for we
know something of the dangerous operations of an army
in the hands of Beauregard.” In order to dissipate the
doubts of some skeptical as to which side the operations
of Beauregard would be dangerous, the same journal
announced with pleasure the arrival of that chieftain and
his staff at Nickerson’s Hotel in Columbia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Sherman, in a brief time, cleared away the
painful doubts from the mind of this editor. Taking
Kingsville, he commenced a skirmishing march on Columbia.
While the quiet of a pleasant evening was settling
down upon Columbia, a sudden shriek in the air
startled the inhabitants. The signal shells of approach
were fired from “Yankee” guns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The army then under cover of darkness moved up the
river, and in the morning forded the Saluda and Broad Rivers.
While the waters were surging around the cheerful
host, the enemy decided that “prudence was the better part
of valor,” and hastened out of the capital. The female employés
of the treasury department were hurried off to
Charlotte, a panic-smitten company of maidens, young
and old; lithographic presses for the currency were left
behind; and a large amount of medical stores was seized
by our troops. General Sherman pressed forward toward
Charlotte after Beauregard, who was completely in the
fog respecting the goal of his antagonist—whether it was
Charlotte, North Carolina, a hundred miles from Columbia,
or Florence, South Carolina, ninety miles away,
likewise a railroad centre. The map again will shed
light on the field of this great game of war. The only
road remaining for escape from Charleston was the
threatened track to Florence. Meanwhile General
Gilmore’s time to move near the doomed city had
come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>February 10th, General Schemmelfinnig threw his
command of about 3,000 strong across a bridge laid over
the creek separating Folly and Cole Islands from James
Island, and fastened with firm foothold upon the latter,
only three miles from Charleston. The Fifty-fourth New
York, acting as skirmishers, encountered the enemy a
mile farther, at Grimball’s, on Stono River, up which the
iron-clads <span class='it'>Augusta</span> and <span class='it'>Savannah</span>, and the mortar schooner
<span class='it'>Commodore McDonough</span>, made their way to protect
our forces on the flank, shelling the rebels. Toward
night General Hartwell advanced with his brigade, the
columns double in front dashing upon the rifle-pits
with a shout that assured him of victory. The bloody
struggle was brief. The foe returned to his main works,
leaving less than a hundred of our troops killed and
wounded, and their own, with twenty prisoners, in our
hands. This was the first time these works had been
taken by our troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Potter moved toward Bull’s Bay to cut the
railroad north of the city. General Hatch moved across
the Ashepoo, toward the South Edisto.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Hardee, with General Sherman, master of
Columbia, shutting him on that side, had been watching
with eagle eye the manœuvres of General Potter,
endangering his last highway from the city, and resolved
upon flight. Friday, February 17th, his preparations for it
began. In the night the garrisons of Sullivan’s Island
and Point Pleasant withdrew, just in time to escape General
Potter’s advance on the road by Christ’s Church. For
the movements of Hardee had been discovered by General
Schemmelfinnig’s watchful scouts and signal officers, and
he barely slipped from the grasp of his antagonist. The
troops in the city marched out by the Northeastern Railroad
on Saturday. Wrote Mr. O. G. Sawyer from the
gates of the city:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shortly after daylight it was discovered that there
were no troops in and about Sumter, or Moultrie, or in
the works on James Island. Lieutenant-Colonel Bennett,
of the Twenty-first United States colored troops, commanding
Morris Island, immediately despatched Major
Hennessy, of the Fifty-second Pennsylvania Volunteers,
to Fort Sumter, in a small boat, to ascertain whether the
fort was evacuated. Major Hennessy proceeded to Sumter,
and soon waved the old Stars and Stripes over the
battered battlements of the work, from which they had
been torn down in April, 1861. The sight of the old flag
on Sumter was an assurance that the enemy had evacuated
all their works, and it was hailed by every demonstration
of joy by all, on ship and on shore. Another
boat in charge of Lieutenant Hackett of the Third Rhode
Island artillery, was immediately sent to Fort Moultrie
to take possession of that work, and raise again the national
colors upon its parapet. The navy, anxious to
share in the honors of the day, also launched a boat, and
strove to gain the beach of Sullivan’s Island before the
army, and an exciting race ensued between the boats of
the different branches of the service. Each boat’s crew
were urged on to the utmost by their respective commanders,
and every nerve and muscle was strained to pull
the boats to their utmost speed. It was a friendly but
earnest trial of endurance and skill. Every man felt that
the credit and honor of the service rested on himself, and
redoubled his exertions to attain success. The race was
a close one, the boats being evenly matched; and when
one forged a little ahead it was recognized by the cheers
of its friends, who watched with intense interest the progress
of the contest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Finally, after a hard pull and as fast a race as
Charleston harbor ever witnessed, the army boat, under
Lieutenant Hackett, reached the shore in advance. As
she touched the officer and crew sprang out on the beach,
through the surf, and rushed for the goal. The parapet
was soon gained and the flag given to the breeze, amid
the cheers of the soldiers and sailors, who had come up a
moment or two behind him. The fort was found completely
evacuated, as were all the works on the island.
The guns were all spiked and some of the carriages
somewhat damaged. A large quantity of munitions was
found in the magazines, which the enemy had not found
time to destroy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When the flag floated over Moultrie, Lieutenant-Colonel
Bennett, Major Hennessy, and Lieutenant Burr,
of the Fifty-second Pennsylvania, started out for the city,
leaving orders to have troops follow. They pulled up
the bay, while the rebel iron-clads and vessels were in
flames, and the city itself was burning at various points.
Reaching Fort Ripley, or what is known as the Middle
Ground battery, the flag was displayed over the work,
and waved for a few moments. The party then pushed
on to Castle Pinckney, when the same ceremony of taking
possession was observed, and then the boat was pulled
cautiously, but directly, toward the city. No hostile
force was observed, but a large number of negroes and
some whites were congregated on the docks, watching
the approach of the ‘Yankee boat.’ Colonel Bennett
immediately landed, and ‘Old Glory’ was displayed again
in the city of Charleston, amid the cheers and cries of
joy of the crowd assembled about it. It was a perfect
storm of applause, and outbursts of unfeigned joy and satisfaction.
The negroes, with all their impulsiveness, were
equalled by the whites in their exhibition of satisfaction
and pleasure at the great event. They seized the hands
of the officers and men, and wept with excess of exultation
and delight. Such a scene was never dreamed of
by the most enthusiastic believer in the loyalty of a certain
portion of the citizens of Charleston. It took all our
men by surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On landing it was not deemed advisable by Col. Bennett
to advance into the city, as he was informed that a
rebel brigade was still at the depot, taking the cars, and
that a force of cavalry was scouring the city and impressing
men into the ranks and driving the negroes before
them. As he had but nine men with him he confined
himself merely to sending to Mayor Macbeth the
following peremptory demand for the surrender of the
city:</p>

on a fine horse, rode back to the Mayor to deliver the
communication. He had not proceeded more than a
block or two when he came upon fifty rebel cavalry, who
were watching affairs. They instantly halted the peace
commissioner, and blandly observed that they thought
they should be compelled to dismount him, as they were
under the impression that they would take the horse in
the country. He reflected an instant, and then observed,
in a careless way, that perhaps the Yankees, who had just
landed five hundred strong, might object, and he would
think of the matter. The announcement of the arrival
of five hundred Yankees was quite enough for the bold
troopers. Without taking his horse or further palaver,
they wheeled, and rode wildly up Meeting Street, announcing
the approach of the Yankees to all stragglers,
and there was instantly a great commotion and a hurrying
off trains. Meanwhile the fires were spreading with
great rapidity, and threatened to sweep over the city, until
fifty men from Morris Island reënforced Colonel Bennett’s
little handful of men, when he instantly moved up
into town with twenty-five men, sending small detachments
to take charge of the public buildings and depots.
His march up Meeting Street was one continued ovation.
Crowds thronged the streets and cheered, hurrahed, waved
handkerchiefs, and in other ways manifested their delight
at the arrival of our troops, and at the sight of the old
flag, borne ahead of the little company of colored troops.
The officers were mounted on horses, borrowed for the
occasion, and could hardly keep their saddles, so many
enthusiastic individuals, of both sexes, were at the same
time shaking them by the hand, catching hold of their garments,
hugging their horses, and welcoming them in other
violent styles. Charleston never witnessed such a scene
before, or echoed so loudly to the cheers for ‘President
Lincoln,’ the ‘Stars and Stripes,’ the ‘Yankee army,’
and other patriotic subjects, as it did on that memorable
day. One would suppose that the people had gone mad
with joy. It was a universal outburst of joy, and the
little band of Yankees moved on with all the <span class='it'>éclat</span> of
most honored friends, instead of successful enemies and
conquerors. Was this, indeed, the hotbed of treason;
the very home of disloyalty and rebellion? None would
have dreamed of it had they witnessed the reception of
our flag and troops that day. It was the most wonderful
display of loyalty and patriotism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And thus, after all the terrific cannonading of four years,
with the sufferings and death of the long siege, the “accursed
city” fell without a battle for its possession. When
the Confederate and Palmetto flags were raised on the
walls of Fort Sumter in place of the dishonored banner
of freedom, in the spring of 1861, the boastful Mayor of
Charleston made a flaming speech, declaring that they
should wave there forever!—that Southern independence
was secure, and her career of glory begun. He
assured the enthusiastic people, that if their ensigns were
struck down they would be trailed in “a sea of blood!”
We may leave him to his meditations while we join in
the shouts of victory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing on the walls of Sumter, look away in the
direction of General Sherman’s march. From Atlanta
to the shattered fortress, in this campaign “our great
victories were almost bloodless, and therefore the more
joyous and the more memorable. Branchville fell by
manœuvre, not by the costly price of heroic troops. The
turning of Branchville was the signal for the evacuation
of Charleston, and its capture was the capture of Charleston.
It was as if Sherman, sixty two miles distant from
Hardee, had sent him a telegraphic message to vacate the
premises, and the notice was obeyed without question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ordinarily, one would have supposed that the
streams which crossed Sherman’s path at every step
would have been successfully contested. But he appears
to have passed them without a day’s delay at any one.
Of such vital importance was time to both parties—to the
one, that he might make his combinations and concentrations;
to the other, that he might break them—that no
sacrifice would have seemed too great on the enemy’s part
to ensure delay. But, at the very first show of resistance
at a river crossing, our advance, not waiting for support,
would dash into it, waist deep, with loud cheers, while
the rest of the column hurried to flank the position above
and below, and invariably in a few hours the enemy was
in hot retreat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, the enthusiasm of our troops, with Sherman
as a leader, has known no bounds. They felt themselves
invincible, and have laughed at obstacles. Sixty or
seventy thousand troops is a large force for such operations,
but larger ones have miserably failed. It is large
enough, however, when directed by genius and inspired
by enthusiasm. On the other hand, the enemy has fled
from Sherman’s path as from that of a pestilence. His
troops feel that there is little use in opposing our columns,
and go as quickly as possible to the rear. The unprejudiced
topographer, speculating upon the probable location
of that mysterious region, ‘the last ditch,’ would hitherto
have assigned it to South Carolina. But the ‘great
flanker’ has, in fact, flanked that famous ditch, and it
has been evacuated through fear of enfilading. Day after
day, the theatrical bills of the Confederacy announce ‘one
more and positively the very last ditch;’ and still the
comedy is played. Branchville, Columbia, and Charleston
fell, but we see no Derry, no Saragossa, no Puebla,
in their defence. Lame and impotent conclusion indeed
from such bravado of prologue! The chance of becoming
the sepulchre of the Confederacy will be taken from
South Carolina.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But let us walk over Charleston after its occupation
by our troops. The flames shoot up on every hand, and
the firemen rush to the centres of conflagration. Thousands
of bales of cotton and many buildings are consumed,
amid the frantic distress of the people, who are principally
the poorer classes, left in the wake of retreat. The
depot of the Northeastern Railroad became the arena of
new horrors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this building a quantity of cartridges and kegs
of powder had been stored by the rebels, and as they had
not time to remove it they left it unprotected. A number
of men, women, and children had collected to watch the
burning of a quantity of cotton in the railroad yard,
which the rebels had fired, and during the conflagration
a number of boys, while running about the depot, had
discovered the powder. For the fun of the thing, and
without realizing the danger they incurred, they began to
take up handfuls of loose powder and cartridges and bear
them from the depot to the mass of burning cotton on
which they flung them, and enjoyed a deal of amusement
in watching the flashes of the powder and the strange
effects on the cotton as it was blown hither and thither
by the explosion of the cartridges. Quite a number of
boys soon became engaged in this dangerous pastime, and
speedily the powder running from their hands formed a
train upon the ground leading from the fire to the main
supplies of powder in the depot. The result is easily
conjectured. A spark ignited the powder in the train,
there was a leaping, running line of fire along the ground,
and then an explosion that shook the city to its very
foundations from one end to the other. The building
was in a second a whirling mass of ruins, in a tremendous
volume of flame and smoke. A report rivalling
Heaven’s artillery followed, and then a silence ensued
that, made every one tremble and hold his breath. The
cause of the tremendous explosion soon became known,
and a rush was made for the scene of the catastrophe.
Such a sight is rarely witnessed. The building was in
ruins, and from the burning mass arose the agonizing
cries of the wounded, to whom little or no assistance
could be rendered by the paralyzed spectators. Many,
wounded by the flying fragments of the building were
removed from the additional danger of the fire, but those
in the depot or immediately about it were irretrievably
lost. One by one was reached by the furious flames, the
supplicating voices and the fearful, agonizing groans, that
appalled the stoutest heart, died away and ceased, and
charred remains only were left by the devouring element
as it moved on to new victims, who soon passed amid
that horrid scene from life to death. Language cannot
adequately describe the terrible nature of the scene.
The cries for aid and rescue from the wounded within
fell upon willing ears, but nothing could be done to assist
them or even to alleviate the final pangs. The flames,
like a fabled monster, strode on, licking up every thing
inflammable, and enveloping its victims in its fiery and
deadly embrace. Fortunately the sufferings of the unfortunate
creatures were not prolonged. The work was
done quickly, and soon every voice was silenced, every
moan hushed, and every spirit gathered to its Maker.
The horrors of the scene will never fade from the minds
of those who were so unfortunate as to witness it. Over
one hundred and fifty are said to have been charred in
that fiery furnace, and a hundred men were wounded
more or less seriously by the explosion or were burned
by the fire.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then came the destruction of the rebel fleet. Very
fittingly the <span class='it'>Palmetto State</span> first flew into fragments with
a loud report, which signalled well the fate of the home
of secession, and over it soon swept the free waves.
The <span class='it'>Chicora</span> and <span class='it'>Charleston</span> followed in the work of
ruin. Cotton, rice, tobacco, locomotives, etc., fell into
our hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The reports of the Charleston editors that the city
experienced but little damage from our shells, like nearly
all others emanating from the same source, were essentially
false. It requires no very extended examination in
the lower streets of the city—those near the bay—to satisfy
the most sceptical of the fact that our shells were
working most serious injury to the town, and that the
continuance of the bombardment would make it a mass
of ruins, as it had already rendered it untenable to the
most courageous resident. But two persons resided in
‘Shell-town,’ as some wag named that portion of the city
east of the two-mile post, visited by our shells, and they
clung to their firesides with a tenacity of purpose that the
most demonstrative and aggressive Parrott shell failed to
relax. Though their beds were torn to pieces while they
were engaged in their domestic affairs—both being females—by
impertinent shells, and their culinary affairs
seriously damaged by projectiles, their roofs perforated,
and ventilators put in front of their dwellings, they would
not move, but endured the bombardment with a coolness
and equanimity rarely found. Even the rebel officers,
who ordered them away from the dangerous ground,
failed to call a third time to ascertain whether or not
the order had been obeyed. They lived through the
entire bombardment, became accustomed to the howl of
the rushing shell and its sharp explosion, and paid no
rent, although the buildings they occupied suggested
heavy rents. Now that quiet and safety are insured
they propose to repair and live comfortably once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On landing you observe that the wharves are in a
very dilapidated condition, that tell very plainly that they
have not been much in use the past four years. The
palmetto logs that form the cribs are covered with grass,
and the planking is much decayed, full of man-traps, and
about worthless so far as cartage is concerned. Advancing
up the rickety docks, you come to a parapet of sand,
over which peer the muzzles of heavy guns, bearing down
the channel, for home defence; then around or over the
batteries into the silent streets, covered with the <span class='it'>débris</span>
from shattered stores and dwellings, and bearing at points
a tolerably good crop of grass—the same kind of grass
that was to have sprung up in the streets of New York
when King Cotton exercised his potent sway. Not a
building for blocks here that is exempt from the marks
of shot and shell. All have suffered more or less. Here
is a fine brown-stone bank building, vacant and deserted,
with great gaping holes in the sides and roof, through
which the sun shines and the rain pours, windows and
sashes blown out by exploding shell within, plastering
knocked down; counters torn up, floors crushed in, and
fragments of mosaic pavement, broken and crushed, lying
around on the floor, mingled with bits of statuary, stained
glass and broken parts of chandeliers. Ruin within and
without, and its neighbor in no better plight. Here a
great shell has struck the chimney and crushed a large
portion of the roof in; then exploding, distributed its
fragments through the ceilings, and burst out great
patches of brick and mortar, which now lie on the pavement
below, untouched since they fell. Every imaginable
portion of buildings have been damaged by our fire,
and not a single house in this portion of the town has
escaped. Not a building is occupied, save by the brave
women to whom I have already referred, and the front
doors or windows gape open, through which you may
gaze upon battered offices, demolished stores and counting-rooms
in ruin, where commerce once dwelt and active
business men pursued their respective vocations unmolested
and undisturbed. The churches, St. Michael’s
and St. Philip’s, have not escaped the storm of our projectiles.
Their roofs are perforated, their walls scarred,
their pillars demolished, and within, the pews filled with
plastering or fragments of mural tablets, which were to
perpetuate the memory of some good man long asleep in
the grave-yard near by. You may count up a round
number of shell-holes in their steeples, and many upturned
monuments in their grave-yards. War is cruel,
and the howling projectile that takes its start four miles
and a half away is indifferent whether it ploughs up the
marble that affection has placed over the remains of long
buried worth, or crashes into the political halls where
treason is plotted or crime against humanity is conceived.
The cold iron has been no respecter of property
in Charleston. The good and bad, rich and poor, criminal
and saint—if there be any of the latter here—have
received visits from the Parrott projectiles, and keenly
felt the justice of the visitation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>February 19th, Charleston was placed under martial
law. Some of the regulations had a peculiar interest
in the reference made to <span class='it'>colored</span> officers; a condition of
things in that most <span class='it'>southern</span> of the cities of the South, in
its love of the “peculiar institution,” the wildest reformer
did not dream of four years ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Sherman disdained the display of success on
entry into South Carolina, and remained on the hostile territory
surrounded with mystery, caring only, in his own
language, to do “a man’s share” in suppressing the
frightful revolt. On February 19th, he was at Winsboro,
thirty miles north of Columbia, on the railroad leading
to Charlotte. The first telegram from him was dated at
Laurel Hill, North Carolina, March 8th, saying: “We
are all well, and have done finely.”</p>

Characteristics—Interesting Recollections of General Sherman—His pure
Character.
</div>

<p class='noindent'><img src='images/t.jpg' style='float:left;' alt='T'/>HE able General Schofield has been successful
in the Department of North Carolina. Wilmington
was compelled to strike the Confederate
flag, and “Cavalry Sheridan” sent Early’s
troops “whirling” from his path whenever
they measured swords on the battle-field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With light spreading toward the zenith from every
part of the horizon of our land, the first spring month is
passing away. The rebellion grows weak and furious,
hastening to the overthrow for which all true freemen
have prayed, and which despots great and small have only
feared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While General Sherman was on his way to Richmond,
piercing the Carolinas with his lines of march
and driving the rebel armies from his path, two important
events transpired outside of martial movements. One
was the sending of “peace commissioners” from Richmond,
early in February, who were met near General
Grant’s headquarters by the President and Secretary
Seward, and whose conference left the question of peace
where it was before, in the hands of Generals Grant and
Sherman. The other memorable event was the passage
of the Constitutional Amendment by Congress,
forbidding, after its approval by three-fourths of the
States, involuntary servitude, excepting for crime, throughout
the land. It was an occasion of intense interest in
the national Capitol, followed by similar scenes in the
loyal North, giving to the celebration of Washington’s
Birth Day an importance in connection with the recent
victories which was never known before, nor is it likely
to have again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Sherman has from the beginning of the war
shown those great qualities of generalship rarely combined,
even in successful commanders. His genius reminds
us of Napoleon Buonaparte in the comprehensive
appreciation of the entire field of action and the exact
issue, in high military culture, in the daring campaigns
which have given him a preëminence among the few who
stand alone in their unquestioned mastery of the art of
war and ability to meet its largest responsibilities, and
in a statesmanship equal to his military attainments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever question in the complicated interests of the
stirring times he touches, it finds a clear and decisive
answer. He has studied history, and the principles which
lie at the foundation of the Republic. He is not cruel,
but believing war to be simply an engine of destruction to
secure an ultimate good which can be reached by no
peaceful means, his policy is the legitimate working of
that engine. He would wield it with no tears of false
philanthropy that would protract the appeal to its sanguinary
settlement of difficulties, nor with the vacillation
that would spare the enemy present suffering and secure
a greater amount of sorrow in the future. Loyal, patriotic,
and modest, he has kept his eye on the national
ensign through untold labors and perils, amid detraction
and the rivalries of a mean ambition, holding the rein
upon his war-horse with a warm but unrelaxing grasp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a highly nervous temperament and manner, he
is always calm and self-possessed in action. Genial and
sincere his troops admire and love him, and are ready to
follow him to the bosom of a boundless wilderness
thronged with foes, or into the swamps waist deep to
storm a fortress beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since this biography was written some pleasant
reminiscences of General Sherman have appeared in the
Leavenworth <span class='it'>Conservative</span>, of Kansas, which, on account
of their interesting character, are here added to his life:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Citizens of Leavenworth will remember that there
stood on Main Street, between Delaware and Shawnee,
in 1857, 1858, and 1859, on the ground now occupied by
handsome brick buildings, a shabby-looking, tumbling,
cotton-wood shell. It was occupied, on the ground floor,
by Hampton P. Denman, ex-mayor, as a land agency
office. The rooms above were reached by a crazy-looking
stairway on the outside, up which none ever went
without dread of their falling. Dingy signs informed the
curious that within was a ‘law shop,’ kept by Hugh
Ewing, Thomas Ewing, Jr., W. T. Sherman, and Daniel
McCook. Those constituted the firm known here in the
early part of 1859 as Ewing, Sherman, &amp; McCook. All
were comparatively young men. All were ambitious;
the one who has gained the greatest fame, perhaps, the
least so of the associated lawyers. The Ewings had the
advantage of high culture, considerable natural abilities,
cold, impassive temperaments, and a powerful family influence
to aid their aspirations. Hugh Ewing was but
little known hereabouts, though acknowledged to be a
brilliant and versatile genius by his intimates. ‘Young
Tom,’ as the other scion is familiarly called, has always
been a prominent and influential man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The third member of the firm fills to-day one of the
proudest pages in the history of our land. His name and
fame take rank with the greatest of earth. All conspire
to do him honor. Aliens bow to his genius, and enemies
show the extent of their fears of its power by the virulence
of their hate and its manifestations. W. T. Sherman
never mingled in our public affairs. He lived
among us for several months, having some landed interests
here. An outlying part of our city plat is marked
on the maps as ‘Sherman’s Addition.’ Prior to entering
upon the practice of law in this city, he lived for some
time in the vicinity of Topeka, upon a farm of one hundred
and sixty acres, which we believe he still owns. His
neighbors tell of his abrupt manner, reserved, yet forcible,
speech and character. Previous to residing in Kansas,
Sherman lived in California, where, as a miner, banker,
and lawyer, he made and lost a large fortune. A graduate
of West Point, he had previously held a captain’s
commission in the Topographical Engineer Corps, and, in
pursuance of duty, had made several important surveys
and explorations, the reports of which had been duly published
by Government. They relate principally to routes
for the Pacific Railroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good story is told of Sherman’s experience as
counsel, and of his dissolution of partnership to take the
position held by him when the war broke out—that of
President of the Military College of Louisiana.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“While in the practice of the law here, Sherman was
consulting partner, having an almost insurmountable objection
to pleading in court. He is accorded the possession,
as a lawyer, of thorough knowledge of legal principles;
a clear, logical perception of the points and equity
involved in any case. He could present his views in the
most direct manner, stripped of all verbiage, yet perfectly
accurate in form. He was perfectly <span class='it'>au fait</span> in the authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But to return to our story. Shortly after the reception
of the offer from the Governor of Louisiana in relation
to the college, Sherman was compelled to appear
before the Probate Judge—Gardner, we believe. The
other partners were busy, and Sherman, with his authorities
and his case all mapped out, proceeded to court. He
returned in a rage two hours after. Something had gone
wrong. He had been pettifogged out of the case by a
sharp, petty attorney opposed to him, in a way which
was disgusting to his intellect and his convictions. His
<span class='it'>amour propre</span> was hurt, and he declared that he would
have nothing more to do with the law in this State.
That afternoon the business was closed, partnership dissolved,
and in a very short time Sherman was on his
way to a more congenial clime and occupation. The
war found him in Louisiana, and despite of his strong
pro-slavery opinions, found him an intense and devoted
patriot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We met him here, and though but slightly acquainted,
have remembered ever since the impression he
left on our mind. He sphered himself to our perception
as the most remarkable intellectual embodiment of force
it had been our fortune to encounter. Once since, we
met him in our lines before Corinth, where he had command
of the right wing of Halleck’s magnificent army.
The same impression was given then, combined with the
idea of nervous vitality, angularity of character, and intense
devotion to what he had in hand. Sherman is
truly an idealist, even unto fanaticism, though, in all
probability, if told so, he would abruptly retort back an
unbelieving sarcasm. He outlines himself to our memory
as a man of middle stature, nervous, muscular frame,
with a long, keen head, sharply defined from the forehead
and back of the ears. His eyes have a bluish-gray
cast, and an introverted look, but full of smouldering fire.
His mouth is sharp and well cut; the lower part of the
face powerful, but not heavy. His complexion fair, and
hair and beard of a sandy-red, straight, short, and strong.
His temperament is nervous sanguine, and he is full of
crotchets and prejudices, which, however, never stand in
the way of practical results. The idea, or rather object,
which rules him for the time, overrides every thing else.
Round the mouth we remember a gleam of saturnine
humor, and in the eyes a look of kindness which would
attract to him the caresses of children.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such are the impressions left on our mind by the
only military educated member of this legal quartette—all
of whom have held commissions as Generals in our
army.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall give you, reader, from the pen of a friend, the
Rev. Mr. Alvord, a pioneer in the religious army-work,
who has been much with General Sherman, the best pen-picture
of him which has appeared, and which has never
before been published: “Tall, lithe, almost delicately
formed. If at ease stoops slightly; when excited, erect
and commanding. Face stern, savage almost; yet smiling
as a boy’s when pleased. Every movement, both of
mind and body, quick and nervous. A brilliant talker,
announcing his plans, but concealing his real intention.
A graceful easy rider, when leading a column looking
as if born only to command. Approachable at times,
almost to a fault, again not to be approached at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw him in a grand review at Savannah. His
position was in front of the Exchange on Bay Street.
The Twelfth Corps was to pass before him; he rode
rapidly to the spot, almost alone, leaped from his horse,
stepped to the bit and examined it a moment, patted the
animal on the cheek, then adjusted his glove, looked
around with an uneasy air as if in want of something to
do; catching in his eye the group of officers on the balcony
he bowed, and commenced a familiar conversation,
quite unconscious of observation by the surrounding and
excited crowds. Presently music sounded at the head of
the approaching corps. Quick as thought he vaulted to
the saddle and was in position. There was peculiar grace
in the gesture of arm and head which did not weary, as
for an hour he returned the salutes of every grade of
officers. Reverence was added as the regimental flags
were lowered before him. The more blackened and torn
and riddled with shot they were, the higher the General’s
hat was raised and the lower his head was bent in recognition
of the honored colors. Every soldier, as he marched
past, showed that he loved his commander. He evidently
loved his soldiers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw him in his princely headquarters at Charles
Green’s, on New Year’s Day. Many were congratulating
him. He was easy, affable, magnificent. Presently
an officer with hurried step entered the circle and handed
him a sealed packet. He tore it open instantly, but did
not cease talking. Read it, still talking as he read.
Commodore Porter had despatched a steamer, announcing
the defeat at Fort Fisher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Butler’s defeated!’ he exclaimed, his eye gleaming
as it lifted from the paper. ‘<span class='it'>Fizzle—great fizzle!</span>’ nervously,
‘knew ’twould be so. I shall have to go up there
and do that job—eat ’em up as I go and take ’em back
side.’ Thus the fiery heart exploded, true to loyalty and
country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I entered the rear parlor and sat down at the glowing
grate. He came, and leaning his elbow upon the
marble mantel, said: ‘My army, sir, is not demoralized—has
improved on the march—Christian army I’ve got—soldiers
are Christians, if anybody is—noble fellows—God
will take care of them—war improves character.
My army, sir, is growing better all the while.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expressed satisfaction at having such testimony,
and the group of officers who stood around could not
suppress a smile at the General’s earnest Christian eulogium.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such is W. T. Sherman. A genius, with greatness
grim and terrible, yet simple and unaffected as a
child. The thunderbolt or sunbeam, as circumstances
call him out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the march from Atlanta his order was ‘No
plunder by the individual soldier;’ but his daily inquiry
as he rode among them would be, ‘Well, boys, how do
you get along? like to see soldiers enterprising; ought to
live well, boys; you know I don’t carry any thing in my
haversack, so don’t fail to have a chicken leg for me
when I come along; must live well boys on such a march
as this.’ The boys always took the hint. The chicken
leg was ready for the General, and there were very few
courts-martial between Atlanta and Savannah to punish
men for living as best they could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When McAllister fell, he stood with his staff and
Howard by his side, awaiting the assaulting column.
‘They are repulsed,’ he exclaimed, as the smoke of
bursting torpedoes enveloped the troops; ‘must try something
else.’ It was a moment of agony. The strong
heart did not quail! A distant shout was heard. Again
raising his glass the colors of each of the three brigades
were seen planting themselves simultaneously on the
parapet. ‘The fort is ours,’ said he, calmly. He could
not restrain his tears. ‘It’s my old division,’ he added.
‘I knew they’d do it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘How long, General,’ said a Southron, ‘do you think
this war will last; we hear the Northern people are nearly
exhausted?’ ‘Well, well,’ said he, ‘about six or seven
years of this kind of war, then twenty or twenty-five of
guerrilla, until you are all killed off, then we will begin
anew.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A wealthy planter appealing to his pity, ‘Yes, yes,’
said he, ‘war is a bad thing, <span class='it'>very</span> bad, cruel institution—very
cruel; but you brought it on yourselves, and you are
only getting a taste of it.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The English ex-consul asked him for protection and
a pass on the ground of his neutrality and that of his
country. ‘Don’t talk to me,’ said Sherman, ‘of your
neutrality, my soldiers have seen on a hundred battle
fields the shot and shell of England with your queen’s
mark upon them all, and they <span class='it'>never</span> can forget it. Don’t
tell me you couldn’t leave before I came; you could send
out your cotton to pay Confederate bonds and bring cannon
in return—don’t tell me you couldn’t get away <span class='it'>yourself</span>.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The consul stood abashed, and awkwardly bowed
himself from his presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such is his treatment of rebels. He receives no
apology nor has any circumlocution. He strikes with
his battalions; he strikes with every word he utters,
whether from pen or lips. The secessionists of Georgia
and South Carolina believe he’ll do what he threatens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Said the rebel colonel who had placed the torpedoes
in the Savannah River, when ordered to take them up,
‘No! I’ll be d——d if I do any such drudgery.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>Then you’ll hang to-morrow morning</span>; leave me,’
said the stern commander. The torpedoes were removed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In this way, by his words, his manner, his personal
presence, his threats with their literal execution, and the
swift and utter destruction in the track of his army on
their late march, he has struck terror to all hearts.
Though thoroughly secretive, he is strangely frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Give me your pass, General?’ said I; ‘I’ll meet
you again on your march.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘You don’t know where I am going,’ said he, with
emphasis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I think I do, General, if I can catch you.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘<span class='it'>Where?</span>’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘At Charleston.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m not going to Charleston.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘Then, at Wilmington.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m not going to Wilmington.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’ll see you, I think, in Richmond.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘I’m not going to Richmond. You don’t know
where I’m going. Howard don’t know.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he gave me the pass; I, at least, know where
he was not going.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The country may well honor and admire General
Sherman. His personal presence is an army of itself.
His army is duplicated by the spirit with which he inspires
it. Such a man wields destiny. God will guide
his way. May He sanctify him. We shall hear more of
him hereafter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Sherman’s character from childhood has been
above reproach, and his honor unsullied. His amiable
wife is a member of the Roman Catholic Church, while
he, as has been intimated, usually attends the Episcopal
service. Besides the death of his son recorded in these
pages, within a year he has lost a child he had never
seen—born while he was in the smoke of battle; the
young spirit went to heaven before the father’s eye could
rest on its earthly greeting to him through the smile of
infancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But a nation sympathizes with him in his sublime
self-denial and his griefs, and in the language of our
beloved President, “follows him with its prayers.”</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
